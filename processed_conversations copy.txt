{"1": "Kandra: Ok", "2": "Nevada: Hello Guys i need help\n\nThe issue is: I want to set up \"AdminLTE-2.4.5\" theme+CRUD in Django App at front-side, I get many answers like direct cmd through installing it and I do it but i don't know how to set up for the view\n\nPlease give solution step by step or any other solution regarding how to install AdminLTE-2.4.5 theme+CRUD and show in front side\n\nReply Soon\n\nThanks [SEP] Sharolyn: i have same  \"connection.ini\" files in different folder ,  how can i be assure that which location is being picked up ? ```from configparser import ConfigParser\n\nconfig = ConfigParser()\n\nconfig.sections()\n\n#config.read('database.ini')\nconfig.read('[<http://topsecret.server.com|topsecret.server.com>]', 'Port')\nfor section_name in config:\n    print('Section:', section_name)\n\n    print ( config.get('<http://topsecret.server.com|topsecret.server.com>','Port'))``` [SEP] Sharolyn: database.ini file is below [SEP] Sharolyn: ```[postgresql]\nhost=ap20-pgs-425.\ndatabase=email_s425\nuser=user\npassword=test@\n\n[<http://topsecret.server.com|topsecret.server.com>]\nPort = 2222\nForwardX11 = no``` [SEP] Nevada: may be  \"servername/connection/connection.ini\" [SEP] Rubie: Morning this hopefully should be an easy one for someone, the problem is in example 2, I'm expected the space to be replace with a 0 ```# Example 1\na = 400\ns = '0.%02sem' % str(a)[:-1]\n\nprint(s)  # actual outcome  // 0.40em\nprint('0.40em')  # expected outcome  / 0.40em\n\n\n# Example 2\na = 80\ns = '0.%02sem' % str(a)[:-1]\n\nprint(s)  # actual outcome  /  0. 8em\nprint('0.08em')  # expected outcome  /  0.08em```\nSo in short, if a is 2 digits or 3 digits it'd format differently [SEP] Raven: It seems to me that this should be a numerical conversion, rather than converting it to a string and picking individual characters out. [SEP] Raven: Leading zeros is something you apply to numbers rather than to strings. You're lucky that the first example works because it doesn't need any leading zeros. [SEP] Rubie: Okay I'll rethink this one :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Rubie: This seems to work, is this the best way to do it do you think ```# Example 1\na = int(str(400)[:-1])\ns = f\"0.{a:02}em\"\n\nprint(s)  # actual outcome  /  0.40em\nprint('0.40em')  # expected outcome  /  0.40em\n\n# Example 2\na = int(str(80)[:-1])\ns = f\"0.{a:02}em\"\n\nprint(s)  # actual outcome  /  0.08em\nprint('0.08em')  # expected outcome  /  0.08em``` [SEP] Raven: no [SEP] Raven: If you're just trying to show numbers that have decreased by some amount, there is no need to convert them to strings and extract substrings [SEP] Rubie: I do need to remove the last digit [SEP] Raven: To change 400 to 0.4, you divide by 1000. If you then want to format 0.4 as 0.40, that is something you do in the string formatting stage [SEP] Raven: ```\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \"{:.2f}\".format(0.4)\n'0.40'\n``` [SEP] Rubie: ```# Example 1\na = 400 / 1000\ns = f\"{a:.2f}em\"\n\n# Example 2\na = 80 / 1000\ns = f\"{a:.2f}em\"``` [SEP] Rubie: Works great", "3": "Carmel: Hi everyone :smile:\nsay you have a list `_list = ['hello', 'world', 'pikachu']` and a string `greeting = 'hello, my name is pikachu'`\nhow would you assert that any of the elements in the list are in the string ?

[SEP] Conchita: What I want is to write a print statement outside my class.

See line 4 - that's an example of you using the MongoClient class to create an 'instance' of MongoClient. Then you can perform actions on that instance. You need to do the same for your class. [SEP] Raven: (What you have currently is an attempt to call the function directly on the class itself, which is almost never what you want. Sadly Python's error message for this is not as clear as it could be.) [SEP] Raven: Finally, note that the `address_lookup` function will not need to take an `address` argument [SEP] Conchita: Ok, so first I need to create an instance like ```a = Skye('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx' 1203, 0.3)``` then ```a.address_lookup('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx')``` ? [SEP] Raven: Yes, but note the last thing I said [SEP] Conchita: Nice, got it. So ```a = Skye('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx' 1203, 0.3)``` then ```a.address_lookup()``` [SEP] Conchita: ? [SEP] Raven: Looks reasonable to me [SEP] Conchita: Great, thanks for the explanation! This is probably a stupid question, but here goes. Would it be possible to create an instance like you showed me here, without providing all arguments I have included in the `def __init__` ? Could i do ```a = Skye('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx')```? [SEP] Raven: You could give those arguments default values [SEP] Conchita: like this?

[SEP] Asha: If I'm understanding you correctly, I believe the easiest way to accomplish this is to set ```slack_data``` inside the if block, and use an else to cover the case that there is no keyword found from the color_keywords list [SEP] Asha: That way the conditional would be responsible for setting slack_data, and you could cover both cases [SEP] Rocio: and you probably want `temp=40, bol=0` [SEP] Rocio: strings and integers are not the same thing [SEP] Rocio: you also probably want `FarenheitToCelsius` and `CelsiusToFarenheit`, it's better practice.

[SEP] Kiera: have you created a virtual environment using the `virtualenv` command? [SEP] Sau: yes [SEP] Kiera: okay. [SEP] Sau: but everytime I need to run the script [SEP] Sau: I have to activate the virtualenv [SEP] Ashley: <@Sau> a virtual env is mostly just a modification to your PATH variable so when you reference python, it looks for the executable in your virtual env's directory first.  [SEP] Kiera: you can also run the script by using the `bin/python` program in the virtual environment directory. [SEP] Kiera: if you created a virtual environment called `$HOME/venv`, then you would run `$HOME/venv/bin/python mypythonscript.py` [SEP] Ashley: If you reference it directly, you mostly don't need the virtual env [SEP] Jimmy: referencing the python inside the environment is the same as activating and then executing [SEP] Alvina: does Alembic make sense for tables based on ingesting CSV or other files where the output can change without warning? for example, a client adds or removes certain columns to the file [SEP] Kiera: alternatively, you can do something like `(. $HOME/venv/bin/activate; python mypythonscript.py)` [SEP] Kiera: if you put it in `()` parentheses, you can then put the entire thing in the backgrouund `(\u2026) &amp;`. [SEP] Sau: so [SEP] Sau: what is the $HOME [SEP] Kiera: but just running directly from the virtual environment's `python` is easier:  `$HOME/venv/bin/python mypythonscript.py &amp;` [SEP] Sau: Can I do source /venv/bin/python \u2026 [SEP] Ashley: HOME is another environment variable like PATH [SEP] Kiera: replace `$HOME/venv` with the path to your virtual environment.  That was just an example. [SEP] Ashley: It just says where your home directory is [SEP] Sau: ah [SEP] Sau: I can do pwd to see the path [SEP] Kiera: so - if you created the virtual environment in `/tmp/mypython`, you would use `/tmp/mypython/bin/python`. [SEP] Sau: Yeah so I have the src code being outside of the env package [SEP] Sau: I think I can do () [SEP] Kiera: where the source code lives doesn't actually matter. [SEP] Sau: (. $HOME/venv/bin/activate; python src/mypythonscript.py) [SEP] Kiera: the virtual environment directory is there to contain the python modules that are installed in that virtual environment, not to contain your source code that is using that python. [SEP] Ashley: Yep [SEP] Kiera: so you can use `\u2026/venv/bin/python src/mypythonscript.py` directly no matter where the virtual environment and/or `mypythonscript.py` are. [SEP] Sau: ah [SEP] Sau: So I can use the () parantheses to indicate the linux to run background right? [SEP] Sau: Like (/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python src/myphthon.py) [SEP] Kiera: no, the `()` are to allow you to group commands together into a subshell and run the group of commands in the background. [SEP] Ashley: The python executable for your virtual env is basically hardcore to look at those directories in that venv's directory [SEP] Sau: So i did the following thing [SEP] Sau: (/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python  src/app.py ) &amp; [SEP] Sau: it is working okay but when it exit the terminal [SEP] Sau: it is opted out [SEP] Sau: hmm, I am wondering what I do wrong [SEP] Clemmie: You need to use either `nohup` before the command, which tells it to ignore the logout (the `&amp;` just sends it to the background)  Alternatively, and I think better, you can run everything in `tmux`, which gives you a terminal that persists between sessions [SEP] Sau: nohup (/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python  src/app.py ) &amp;\n-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python\u2019 [SEP] Sau: when I did the nohup , but the seems like to have the error [SEP] Kiera: first off [SEP] Kiera: you don't use the `()` if you only are running a single command. [SEP] Sau: ah [SEP] Sau: Cool Cool [SEP] Sau: :smile: [SEP] Rocio: or better yet, use a systemd service or whatever your supervisor is [SEP] Kiera: it also should be possible to do this without `nohup`, since `nohup` will annoyingly create a file `nohup.out` with the output from the script. [SEP] Kiera: you can try this:\n```\n/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python src/app.py &lt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;\n``` [SEP] Sau: May I ask for the alternative way <@Kiera>? [SEP] Kiera: try that, see if it works to continue running the script after the shell exits. [SEP] Rocio: `nohup ... &gt; /dev/null` works too if you don't want the nohup.out file [SEP] Kiera: okay.  that doesn't work for all versions of nohup, but if it works for debian, that's great. [SEP] Sau: Thank you <@Rocio> and <@Kiera> [SEP] Sau: it is all fun [SEP] Sau: so I guess with the java jar build file [SEP] Sau: I could do the same thing [SEP] Kiera: some versions of `sh`, `ksh`, `zsh`, `csh`. [SEP] Kiera: (and `csh` variants) [SEP] Sau: so <@Kiera> [SEP] Sau: home/ubuntu/booking-calendar-clx/booking-back-end/build/libs/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar &lt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; [SEP] Clemmie: I would still suggest working in tmux - it gets rid of all these issues because the tmux shell itself persists. I haven\u2019t had to use `nohup` or `&amp;` in the 4 years since I started using tmux [SEP] Clemmie: oh - is this supposed to be automated a the end? It read like <@Sau> wants to fire it off and leave the session [SEP] Kiera: yep yep which? :) [SEP] Sau: just kicks off the execution and exit the terminal [SEP] Rocio: <@Clemmie> the _correct_ solution is to use a supervisor, such as systemd, runit, supervisord, etc [SEP] Asha: Something like this possibly for the color keyword part ``` if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in color_keywords):\n                slack_data = {'attachments': [{'pretext': 'I detected the following word:', 'text': *msg_1*, 'color': '#3fce00', 'icon_emoji': ':cat:','as_user': 'false',}]}\nelse \n                slack_data = {'attachments': [{'pretext': 'I detected the following word:', 'text': msg, 'color': '#3fce00', 'icon_emoji': ':cat:','as_user': 'false',}]}``` [SEP] Clemmie: This sounds like a desire to do it interactively though [SEP] Kiera: <@Sau> :\na)  are these commands that you are running by hand, or do you want to run them automatically (cron, or run in docker containers, etc.) ?\nb)  do you care about capturing the output of the programs that get run ? [SEP] Asha: Using nested if statements isn't great, and I'm sure someone else could help you with something better, but that's the quick and dirty way I would think of first, before refactoring [SEP] Sau: so these commands are basically running by hand , and really want to run them automatically [SEP] Sau: and also i don;\u2019t care about the ouput [SEP] Sau: :smile: [SEP] Kiera: do you need to run them in sequence?  (i.e. first run X, then run Y, then run Z) [SEP] Sau: ah no [SEP] Clemmie: I enjoy supervisor <@Rocio>. But a question if you are well versed at it. Do you have a good way to restart a supervisorctl on system restart? I\u2019ve not yet come across a great solution that doesn\u2019t feel hacky [SEP] Sau: they are all runing indepentdently [SEP] Kiera: <@Sau> do you know how they will be automatically run? [SEP] Clemmie: <@Sau> <@Kiera> - Maybe cron then? It handles this cleanly by default. It would be perfect if you want it to run automatically at specified times and recurrence intervals [SEP] Kiera: <@Clemmie> yes, that's what i'm trying to get to :) [SEP] Rocio: <@Clemmie> systemd service :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Clemmie: :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Rocio: I prefer using whatever init I'm using on the system [SEP] Sau: let me try with crob [SEP] Rocio: well, you could [SEP] Clemmie: tech debt i guess [SEP] Rocio: systemd has a lot of options related to being a supervisor [SEP] Clemmie: I also work on some old systems, so need to take a look at if all of them even have systemd [SEP] Rocio: then good old sysvinit with dependencies in the comments.. :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Kiera: <@Sau> if you need help with cron, feel free to ping me in a direct DM message - this is no longer about python :) [SEP] Sau: It is something esle [SEP] Sau: I am trying to run some tests here [SEP] Kiera: <@Clemmie> <@Rocio> i pretty much despise systemd :( [SEP] Sau: :smile: [SEP] Rocio: I embraced it. :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Rocio: I usually use runit for containers though [SEP] Asha: Or even better, you could just use a double conditional so  (in psuedo code) ```if keyword in keyword_list and color_keyword_list:\n                set slack_message_with_extra_msg\nelse\n               set slack_message``` [SEP] Kiera: <@Rocio> i \"volunteered\" you to <@Sau> to talk about how to get his python script running as a system service via `systemd` :) [SEP] Jimmy: <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/systemd-essentials-working-with-services-units-and-the-journal> [SEP] Rocio: <@Kiera> thanks but no thanks :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Rocio: that DO link looks good ^ [SEP] Jimmy: we generally try to encourage people to ask question in public.

[SEP] Candra: <@Bethany> Yeah, I think I may just write documentation within the code and clean up the code base. I feel like the majority of the concern I have, since I'm leaving this job, is that the sheer amount of code I've developed in my time here is pretty overwhelming to someone new coming in and most of what I've written are small scripts. Maybe simply writing docs within each script is a better/easier approach that way documentation written by whoever takes my spot here can be done in the same fashion without me having to also write documentation about writing docstrings etc...

Objects contain keys which are strings (and only strings) mapped to values which may be numbers, strings, objects, or arrays of numbers, strings, objects, or arrays.

[SEP] Hai: <@Kiera> so should i remove the json.dumps and directly loop through response?? but response has \"u\" is it okay?/ [SEP] Kiera: i don't know what `request` and `response` are, so i can't tell you whether looping through response is what you need to do.  if `response` is a Python list, or something that acts like a Python list, then `for item in response` would work in the loop at the bottom.

[SEP] Shan: alright.  so backing up.  give me the script you are working with. [SEP] Shan: are you saying that when you `request.get(my_url)`, you are getting the following as a response? ```\n{u\"temp\": {u\"a\":u\"a1\",u\"b\":u\"b2\",u\"c\":\"c3\"}}\n{u\"temp\": {u\"a\":u\"a2\",u\"b\":u\"b2\",u\"c\":\"c3\"}}\n{u\"temp\": {u\"a\":u\"a2\",u\"b\":u\"b2\",u\"c\":\"c3\"}}``` [SEP] Hai: <@Shan> yes perfect [SEP] Shan: split on a newline, `\\n`, and iterate through each line, and jsonify the line, and append to a list. [SEP] Hai: <@Shan> how would we know the json ends at the same line? my each json is very large [SEP] Shan: okay\u2026do you have control over what the source outputs? [SEP] Hai: <@Shan> [SEP] Hai: yes [SEP] Shan: the smarter thing would be to fix the service you\u2019re `get`ting from to output proper json. [SEP] Hai: <@Shan> no no i dont have that control on that [SEP] Shan: the next way would be to create some functions that iterate through lines and pieces together valid json through a series of checks. [SEP] Shan: but that method would be taxing. [SEP] Hai: <@Shan> yeahh [SEP] Shan: Maybe not.  you could iterate through each line, count the first iteration of `[` or `{` and then count the open brackets before the closing one so that you can intelligently navigate full json. [SEP] Shan: why does the service give you this format for info? [SEP] Hai: <@Shan>I can try that. I don't know it's coming from a different app. I mean actually am getting in that format. did you see my code? [SEP] Hai: None [SEP] Shan: oh dear lord. [SEP] Shan: i incorrectly assumed.  although, i cant see why `response.json()` or `json.dumps(response)` would work. [SEP] Hai: <@Shan> yeahh but after doing json.dumps() it is juts removing the \"u\"  but still not giving a valid json [SEP] Shan: maybe just `split('=')` and hope that its never in the data.  then `split('\\n')` and hope that newlines only exist at the and of a \u201cjson\u201d line. [SEP] Shan: work backwards from there as errors crop up due to this sillyness. [SEP] Hai: yeahh i will try [SEP] Shan: so, this is crude af. [SEP] Hai: hahahha [SEP] Shan: i\u2019m not proud of it.  theres a few things you can do to clean this up but\u2026the gist. [SEP] Shan: but. i challenge you to inspect you data better. [SEP] Shan: see what you can do to manipulate it to fit your needs. [SEP] Sasha: Hahaha. I'd be worried about the `u\"` substitution, if any data contents end with a \"u\". [SEP] Hai: <@Shan> sure [SEP] Shan: oh. im concerned about much of it.  i dont understand how that output from a url is valid output. [SEP] Sasha: \"Just `eval` it!\"  &lt;runs and hides&gt; [SEP] Shan: i mean\u2026i understand it, but it makes me sad. [SEP] Hai: <@Shan> yaaa even metoo [SEP] Shan: so yea.  manipulate the data to fit your needs.  remember, youre a wizard now, learn some new spells, make the data bend to your ~wishes~ manipulations. [SEP] Hai: <@Shan> yeahh but how did you add space after each individual json at line7 ? [SEP] Hai: <@Shan> i didnt see any space but the new json is starting from a new line so should i assume there is a space between each individual json? [SEP] Shan: so, im not querying this endpoint so i dont know what its doing\u2026but when i pasted it into my term, it automatically created `\\n` that i was able to split on.  `\\n` can be invisible characters. [SEP] Shan: ```resp = request.get(my_url)\n\nprint(resp.split('\\n'))\n``` [SEP] Shan: try that first. [SEP] Shan: see what it does.

[SEP] Sasha: <@Mathilde> What your code does is convert all the numbers to strings and then concatenate them, so `my_str` ends up as `\"424911\"`. Then the for loop iterates over it one character at a time, converting back to int, so `my_list` would be `[4, 2, 4, 9, 1, 1]`. Then the `max` function correctly finds the maximum value of 9. [SEP] Mathilde: Thank you <@Sasha> [SEP] Sasha: Note that `max()` already does what you want, in that `max(42, 4, 9, 1, 1)` returns 42.

Hence a GUI or another language is used as a way to display the logic, and or data to a user. UI/UX is the methodology of making that GUI or Display language(HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, as a few examples) Play nicely with users in a fashion that makes it easier for users to understand with out needing to know what goes into the product. Also with markdown, it is a language similar to HTML and slack uses it to interpret the messages typed into the chat boxes, as such symbols such as  _  etc, have special abilities granted to them through the markdown language so it may not be  UI/UX limitation you are working with so much as a markdown limitation, or lack of enough markdown syntax knowledge [SEP] Clint: Udemy has some good programing courses, I teach python at a school here in Utah, but it is not a cheap option, there are also a lot of free resources on line, but they tend to be un organized and you have to be careful that you find current resources, as a lot of stuff out there can be out of date and not of much use for current development practices.

You combine the 2 to improve the over all usage of the application be it a web site, web app mobile app etc.\n\nIn fact because most of the work that goes in to UI/UX is in User research and design, Often the UI/UX lead does very little if any actual programing. They are very customer facing and need to know the current flows in styles in the market, try and improve UX, etc, Most of my friend who work in UI/UX work directly with a front end engineering team so that they (the front end team) can program out the Design and the UI/UX based on his (the UI/UX engineer) research, The Front End team will work with the Back End team to make sure the functionality is happening as it should. The languages Used in Front end languages will always have some direct correlation to restrictions on what can be done from a UI/UX point of view, but as they improve the options on how to use them Will improve as well.\n\nThis is very simplified as there are a lot more moving pieces, but I hope that gives you a better Idea of what is going on.\n\nGood luck in your programing journey [SEP] Jacinta: *'the software a user looks at is what is known as a Front End coding languages' - absolutely not*\n\ncould link to 10 reliable sources that claims this, and that not reliable sources says otherwise\n\n* the software a user looks at is clearly &amp; obviously UI, maybe in one tiny area of 'back-end dev' or a tiny sub-section of society in this universe ppl think the software a user looks is 'Front End coding languages'\n* if in the extremely rare event (0.000011111%) that there are 10 reliable sources, and no reliable sources says otherwise, then this most definitely not what i mean by UX/UI. i ofc mean it in the common usage of the term/word that ppl that actually know about UX/UI talk about\n\n(aka: i've never heard anything so false in my entire life thus far)\n\nUI = user interface (a thing, an object, what the user sees), and that is *not* a methodology (method for a process), and if there's a sub-meaning or related meant/intended by a diff word, im not sure which phrase/word is actually meant. user interface is very obviously\n&amp; im incredibly astounded at how few (proportionally) ppl in the universe know about UX/UI and no wonder why we have such lacking UX/UI in 2019-ongoing, im honestly jsut speechless right now", "81": "Sasha: (You get _italics_ by surrounding the word with underscores.)", "82": "Shan: What the fuck did I just read?

I want one server to match what I have on the other server. Is it safe to remove all packages on the target server and install with requirements.txt file from the source server? [SEP] Maricela: The code on both will be the same [SEP] Clemmie: Not the best practice. Most OS have system python and will depend on some of the installed packages. Use virtual environments [SEP] Clemmie: In particular, I\u2019m pretty sure you will destroy an OS X install doing that [SEP] Kiera: or centos/redhat/etc.  if you try to remove the python packages, you'll remove `yum`. [SEP] Maricela: Good to know. Thanks. [SEP] Maricela: Alternatively, if I ran the requirements.txt would it overwrite any existing packages or install only the ones missing? [SEP] Clemmie: It could replace with different versions - also not a good result. You really want to keep your system python and app python environments separate [SEP] Maricela: Ok. Looks like I need to start migrating things to a virtualenv. [SEP] Maricela: thank you [SEP] Clemmie: Very little to migrate. Create a virtualenv in your preferred way (mkvirtualenv, pyenv, venv, etc.) Activate the env, pip install, and then run as you would [SEP] Maricela: So I wouldn't have to move my django project into that venv? [SEP] Clemmie: Nope. In fact that is an anti-pattern. Having an activated virtual env basically changes your python path to the virtual env from system python, and installs packages in the virtual env\u2019s file structure. [SEP] Maricela: Nice. I'll get started on that then. Thanks again.

You can use it to append to an existing table, though, with `if_exists='append'`. [SEP] Chad: `if_exists=append` is add the same data i.e if the data has 1135 rows after `append` it is showing 2270 rows [SEP] Sasha: Ah, in that case you probably want to filter your dataframe first, such as only keeping any points whose timestamp is greater than the maximum one already in the database. [SEP] Chad: can you please tell me how ? [SEP] Chad: I didnot get [SEP] Sasha: Well, you could get the maximum timestamp in the database with a `SELECT MAX(date_column)` query.

[SEP] Nenita: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'builtin_function_or_method' and 'str' [SEP] Nenita: None [SEP] Nenita: Well i think the only solution I've found so far is converting both dates to a number to make things easier.

It\u2019s not even counting the lines in the test files themselves, although I can see the tests runnning in the terminal on the run command [SEP] Clemmie: <@Nenita> you are getting that error because `datetime.now()` note the parens, is a method - you are referencing the when you skip the parens, not calling it.

[SEP] Lydia: It should be uniform and the same when it comes out at the end; just because you say duckBuilder doesn't mean you are guaranteeing duckCount int type as a return, or even duckName attribute as the return. [SEP] Keva: whats the difference between type hinting (avaiable since python 3.6) and mypy? [SEP] Keva: syntax is the same. [SEP] Ouida: <@Lydia> *of course!!!* and that's what I said. you should avoid duck typing if you know what to expect. but if more than one kind of object is expected, duck typing is the pythonic way.

[SEP] Ouida: <@Keva> mypy is the tool for running static analysis on your *typed* code [SEP] Ouida: the type-hinting, which is part of the standard since 3.5, is just the type annotations (which you can reference in runtime if you really want to).\ntype-hinting is also available in earlier versions, but as comments, that `mypy` and even IDEs like PyCharm can understand.

Not trying to distribute it to PyPI, it's for internal use at my company. The issue I'm having is that the package requires some user input for configuration that I need to store somewhere; currently they just get stored in a `config.ini` file in the package directory. I could of course have a script that generates this config file that they have to run before they install the package, and then the config file gets installed with the package, but that doesn't seem like the best solution. Any ideas? [SEP] Shan: the easiest solution? [SEP] Shan: g#sdispater/poetry [SEP] Leana: <https://github.com/sdispater/poetry> [SEP] Erich: <@Shan> yeah, looked into Poetry. Would be OK with using this, but I'm still equally unsure of how to do what I'm asking. There doesn't seem to be any option or section of the toml file or anything that relates to saving private user info. Also doesn't really help with best practices for saving stuff like this (should it be saved in a user directory, and the package should just expect them to be there? or...) [SEP] Shan: If a program requires a config file to work properly, you should either provide a default one or build in functionality to create one with something like `$program init` which then prompts for input of various things. It should save to the current directory, a project directory, or within the homedir.  You would define that requirement. [SEP] Erich: I see, so I could put the CLI for adding those config values in a name = main block and tell the user to run `python -m mypackage init` or something. edit: I think that requires a `__main__.py` but thats fine too. [SEP] Shan: Is this specifically meant to be a command line util? [SEP] Erich: no, as a library. [SEP] Erich: but the configuration is a CLI [SEP] Shan: If so, you should consider building it so that it functions like one.  `$program init` instead of `python -m $program.__main__ init` [SEP] Shan: Ah [SEP] Erich: I think this is fine; I'll create a `__main__.py` file which will start the CLI for generating the config. That way it can be used after installing the python library and can let you change the configs easily after the library is installed (say if your credentials change) [SEP] Erich: Thanks for the ideas! [SEP] Shan: If you use poetry, you can have it so that when you do `poetry install`, it can create a client tool so that invoking it makes a bit more sense. [SEP] Shan: Im mentioning poetry because it's neat and reducing the overall overhead when creating a package. [SEP] Erich: Ya I'm totally down with using it, I've been wanting to find an excuse for it, so I'm happy for you to push it. How do I hook into the `poetry install` to start that client tool? [SEP] Shan: Yeah.  Its quite glorious [SEP] Erich: honestly have 0 understanding of what your question is asking. Why are you using `eval` at all?

[SEP] Emery: <@Erich> how do I fill those values  [SEP] Erich: It's honestly mostly just for me, and *maybe* a couple other devs, so I'm not too worried about the interface.

You can install python 2.7 normally, and then create a virtual environment that clones your python 2.7 executable. It will become its own environment with its own set of installed packages, and its own `pip` that will install to that environment. Then you can just activate that env whenever you want to work in it [SEP] Rodrick: <@Clarisa> i am on windows [SEP] Rodrick: <@Ashley> how do i create a virtual env [SEP] Rodrick: i havent done that before [SEP] Ashley: no worries [SEP] Ashley: it\u2019s actually pretty easy [SEP] Rodrick: ok [SEP] Ashley: you can just run `pip install virtualenv`, and that will give you a tool to do it [SEP] Rodrick: i have python 3.6 installed rn [SEP] Rodrick: ok [SEP] Ashley: I prefer to use `virtualenvwrapper` as well, and it looks like there\u2019s a specific version for windows [SEP] Ashley: `virtualenvwrapper-win` [SEP] Rodrick: ok i just did that command and the reqierment had already been satisfied [SEP] Ashley: you\u2019ll be making several virtual environments, so you\u2019ll want to create a folder in a specific location to hold all your virtual envs [SEP] Rodrick: how can I launch the tool [SEP] Ashley: (you always want to work in a virtual environment) [SEP] Rodrick: Ok, done [SEP] Ashley: if you run `pip install virtualenvwrapper-win`, it should install that tool [SEP] Rodrick: k [SEP] Ashley: I have to run to a meeting, but this should help guide you through the rest [SEP] Ashley: <http://timmyreilly.azurewebsites.net/python-pip-virtualenv-installation-on-windows/> [SEP] Ashley: I\u2019ll be back in about 15 minutes [SEP] Rodrick: great thanks [SEP] Rodrick: ok [SEP] Rodrick: meeting*", "194": "Malena: There are other ways to set up your virtual environment.

That easily supports \u201cpip freeze\u201d [SEP] Shan: lets back up a bit. [SEP] Shan: why are you wanting to use `conda`? [SEP] Bethany: yeah. Why are you using conda in the first place [SEP] Cathrine: I thought it was easier  [SEP] Bethany: it doesn't look like your using libraries with C-extensions and hte like. I'd just use pip for this [SEP] Shan: why did you think it was easier? [SEP] Shan: lets help you select the right tools [SEP] Cathrine: Yes please [SEP] Bethany: I use conda for scientific computing and data science stuff. It's great for libraries with C dependencies, which is common in those fields. If you don't need it I think it's a bit more difficult to deal with than say pip + venv [SEP] Shan: are you also using conda so that you can specify specific python versions? [SEP] Bethany: yeah [SEP] Cathrine: Yes [SEP] Shan: check out `pyenv` to manage your python versions. [SEP] Bethany: it does a lot. I actually wish the community would stop making extra managers and just make conda better [SEP] Bethany: most of what they do is already in that tool [SEP] Cathrine: Because virtualenv uses python2.7 as default  [SEP] Shan: unsure, ive never felt compelled to use it. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af [SEP] Cathrine: And I\u2019ve tried changing that but no luck too [SEP] Hiroko: incorrect, <@Cathrine> venv uses whatever python version you specify [SEP] Hiroko: sounds like you started the venv incorrectly [SEP] Bethany: do people use `pyenv` to manage multiple pythons if you don't have conda? [SEP] Shan: i do [SEP] Hiroko: I use docker mostly [SEP] Hiroko: so no [SEP] Hiroko: but I can understand the use case [SEP] Bethany: yeah now i prefer to just do docker + miniconda [SEP] Bethany: docker makes the environment stuff irrelevant [SEP] Shan: i use `pyenv` with `direnv`.

[SEP] Cathrine: Yes [SEP] Shan: `yes` what? [SEP] Hiroko: <@Cathrine> sounds like python 2.7 is the default when you do `which python` [SEP] Hiroko: try same venv creation with `python3 ....` [SEP] Hiroko: note this:\n\n```jason@orm$ ~/projects/heron \u2442develop* \uf8ff which python\n/usr/local/bin/python\njason@orm$ ~/projects/heron \u2442develop* \uf8ff python -V\nPython 2.7.14\njason@orm$ ~/projects/heron \u2442develop* \uf8ff python3 -V\nPython 3.6.5\njason@orm$ ~/projects/heron \u2442develop* \uf8ff which python3\n/usr/local/bin/python3\n``` [SEP] Hiroko: system python is 2.7.14 [SEP] Hiroko: specifying `python3` gets the py3 version installed [SEP] Shan: so you could do, `python3 -m venv .venv` and it will create a virtualenv inside of your current directory in a dir called `.venv` [SEP] Cathrine: <@Hiroko> yes but it still shows me packages from my main system, when I do the \u201cpip freeze\u201d which was my initial question  [SEP] Hiroko: again, that\u2019s probably because you\u2019re creating the venv with python2 [SEP] Hiroko: _not_ 3 [SEP] Cathrine: <@Shan> oh ok [SEP] Hiroko: _and_ not specifying the path to the python interpreter you want to use [SEP] Shan: starting from scratch.\n```\n- remove current virtualenv\n- move to the project dir\n- `python3 -m venv .venv`\n- `source ./.venv/bin/activate`\n``` [SEP] Cathrine: Ok what should my first line of code look like? [SEP] Cathrine: <@Shan> ok [SEP] Clint: If you are trying to create an environment that does not bring in the current systems packages, just avoid using freeze. I would recommend installing pipenv with pip, (newer versions of python3 comes with pip pre installed) run pipenv install in the folder you want to create your new environment, and that will give you an empty pip file and pipfile.lock, which you can then add packages to through pipenv install \"desired package name here\" [SEP] Shan: lets get him going with the basics first <@Clint> [SEP] Clint: very clean and simple [SEP] Shan: also, `pipenv` isnt stable.  they are continually releasing breaking changes. [SEP] Shan: its a _neat toy_ [SEP] Clint: I have not had any real issues with it [SEP] Clint: but fair point, I just consider it the easiest way to introduce some one to a virtual environment as it does not need much set up. but you are correct that going through the basics first is probably the better plan [SEP] Cathrine: Thanks guys, very helpful [SEP] Cathrine: I\u2019ll try these steps and give updates ", "199": "Cathrine: Hello guys I\u2019m running Linux and I\u2019m trying to create a virtual environment to start a new Django project so I created a new virtualenv with conda but whenever I try to pip freeze inside my new virtual env it keeps showing me packages from my main system.

[SEP] Ashley: <@Fidelia> that\u2019s a big question, and really depends on the context. Normally, no, you don\u2019t want to be collecting cookies. The browser only sends the cookies to the server that share the same domain and sub-domain as the server they\u2019d be sent to, and the JS on the site only has access to the cookies according to the same restriction. So usually, you only have access to the cookies you would already know about, so there\u2019d be no point in collecting them [SEP] Ashley: things get more complicated with embedded content though [SEP] Fidelia: oh ok what is the use of embeded content? [SEP] Ashley: So I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the \u201clike\u201d button for facebook on sites that aren\u2019t facebook, right? [SEP] Fidelia: yes <@Ashley> [SEP] Ashley: well, those like buttons are actually embedded content and is inside an iframe pointing to facebook. When you see that like button, it means you\u2019re connecting to FB, and they give you a cookie so they can find out every time you visit a site that has one of their like buttons on it [SEP] Ashley: the FB servers know which like button you are seeing and what page it was embedded to [SEP] Ashley: so even if you aren\u2019t logged into FB, or don\u2019t even have a FB account, they can still give you a cookie, and start tracking what pages you go to [SEP] Ashley: they aren\u2019t really collecting the cookie itself [SEP] Ashley: but they are using the cookie they gave you to track where you went on the internet [SEP] Ashley: the same is true for other like buttons, e.g. google plus, pinterest, etc [SEP] Fidelia: oh so that can be routed to what type of similar ads they can display on to your wall? [SEP] Fidelia: what other use of this way of embedded content ? [SEP] Fidelia: ? [SEP] Ashley: the only other use would be encouraging user engagement with the platform, and enabling social media addiction by constantly having its presence everywhere [SEP] Fidelia: oh, so you will have retention rate of existing users [SEP] Ashley: they mostly just want data on people that they can run analyses on and sell to others [SEP] Ashley: yes [SEP] Fidelia: oh [SEP] Fidelia: but that is ok to collect that large amount of data?

Obviously the `None`s but also if you are appending to a list I would expect the whole thing to be wrapped in `[]` [SEP] Clemmie: That `header=None` can you lookup if there is an option for header=False.

[SEP] Olevia: That's the problem [SEP] Olevia: If i want to iterate n time on a method to see if it's convergent or divergent, i dont know how to handle this with python [SEP] Sasha: It's basically impossible. You could have a method which outputs \"1, 1, 1, 1, 1\" for a trillion places, and then suddenly switches to an exponential function. [SEP] Sasha: What problem are you really trying to solve? [SEP] Olevia: I just want to put a serie as \u00e0 parameter for a method who can tell me if the serie is divergent or convergent [SEP] Sasha: Do you have the formula for the series, or do you need to treat it as a black box of outputs? [SEP] Olevia: The objective is to put any formula [SEP] Olevia: And enter the n time to Check [SEP] Marth: So I tested trying the following: [SEP] Sasha: Can you explain how \"n\" matters? Do you want the behavior at infinity, or are you looking for some finite property like \"function is still growing at n\"? [SEP] Marth: `import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nout_path = r\"C:\\Users\\Dan\\Nextcloud\\Python_Testing\\test.xlsx\"\n\nx1 = np.random.randn(100, 2)\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(x1)\n\nx2 = np.random.randn(100, 2)\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(x2)\n\nwriter = pd.ExcelWriter(out_path)\ndf1.to_excel(out_path, sheet_name='x1')\ndf2.to_excel(out_path, sheet_name='x2')\nwriter.save()\nwriter.close()\n` [SEP] Marth: shoot...no \"code\" availabe in thread it seems [SEP] Marth: but anyway, that's a copy/paste from the stackexchange you linked [SEP] Marth: I got a workbook with 2 sheets x1 and x2 [SEP] Marth: then I changed it to not use a writer object [SEP] Marth: import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nout_path = r\"C:\\Users\\Dan\\Nextcloud\\Python_Testing\\test.xlsx\"\n\nx1 = np.random.randn(100, 2)\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(x1)\n\nx2 = np.random.randn(100, 2)\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(x2)\n\n# writer = pd.ExcelWriter(out_path)\ndf1.to_excel(out_path, sheet_name='x1')\ndf2.to_excel(out_path, sheet_name='x2') [SEP] Marth: and all I got was an excelfile with one sheet x2 [SEP] Olevia: Normaly you can test a serie just by trying to find in what n the serie is divergent/convergent [SEP] Nenita: so im assuming i have to use excelwriter? [SEP] Marth: so it looks like you have to use a writer object to write without overwriting? and then you save at the end [SEP] Marth: looks like it [SEP] Nenita: well thanks for the help. you didn't have to go that far, but awesome I now know this. Thanks again. [SEP] Sasha: At any finite n, you can calculate sum(1/n), and it's just a number. Its divergence is only a property at infinity. How would your program use n for this? [SEP] Marth: to be fair, I'm learning pandas/Excel myself right now, so it was a useful exercise for me as well and I learned too! [SEP] Olevia: n number iteration [SEP] Sasha: Explain that. [SEP] Nenita: I usually work with csv being easier to work with imo, but I am having to work with excel now because the statement is emailed to us via xlsx [SEP] Marth: yeah, I've been doing a fair amount of csv &lt;--&gt; python/pandas &lt;--&gt; Excel [SEP] Olevia: Like 1/1+1/2+1/3+...+1/n [SEP] Marth: good times :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Sasha: (Sorry, I need to leave. I don't think we're communicating very well for some reason. Good luck...) [SEP] Olevia: Yeah i see what you tried to ask me [SEP] Clemmie: <@Olevia> do you have a link to a mathematical formulation that exlpains how what you are trying to do is possible? [SEP] Clemmie: Or are you trying to code up an algorithm for analyzing if a series has a limit? [SEP] Clemmie: If the latter use SymPy <https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/series/limitseq.html> [SEP] Clemmie: for reference, I found that by googling \u201cpython calculate the limit of a series\u201d [SEP] Olevia: For the moment i need to check if a series is convergente or divergent, then i will check the series has a limit [SEP] Bethany: Yeah what Ed is saying is true. Any finite series has infinitely many patterns that could explain it [SEP] Bethany: Is this for homework? [SEP] Olevia: Yes [SEP] Olevia: I've searched for some idea or code sample, i found nothing about that [SEP] Olevia: this link explain this using maths : <http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/ConvergenceOfSeries.aspx> [SEP] Clemmie: Wait, if this is for homework shouldn\u2019t you be coding the algorithm? [SEP] Clemmie: Basically implementing what you read in that link? (Which I have not read, just glanced at) [SEP] Briana: I am having a challenge finding information on turning the stdout of a command from subprocess into a dict. Can anyone point me in the direction I need to look please? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nHere is the output\n```\nHOST1\n    data1 = 0\n    data2 = 10\n    data3 = 694d7302424e69627fb6b0dedf9b362c01c6b597\n    data4 = 234910\n    data5 = string.host1.name\n\nHOST2\n    data1 = 12\n    data2 = 23\n    data3 = 7219a50894aede1c48f4a2f888dd57dda9d89230\n    data4 = 29459019324\n    data5 = string.host2.name\n```\n\nI am trying to turn the above data into this\n\n`host1_dict = {'data1':'0','data2':'10','data3':'694d7302424e69627fb6b0dedf9b362c01c6b597','data4':'234910','data5':'string.host1.name'}`\n\n\n`host2_dict = {'data1':'12','data2':'23','data3':'7219a50894aede1c48f4a2f888dd57dda9d89230','data4':'29459019324','data5':'string.host2.name'}` [SEP] Bethany: Though a less precise and possible approach could be to check the difference between consecutive terms. If the difference approaches zero it's a hint that it's converging [SEP] Kiera: <@Briana> are you asking about how to capture the stdout from subprocess or how to manipulate the captured string to create the dictionary you're looking for? [SEP] Briana: Trying to manipulate the str variable that was created in the stdout captured from the command [SEP] Olevia: That's the first idea i tried, but some serie are annoying like 1/n+10000000 [SEP] Bethany: Is this a math or programming class [SEP] Olevia: programming [SEP] Olevia: I'm very interested about python but i admit that this problem is very strange [SEP] Bethany: Do they say to write a program or to do it by hand? [SEP] Briana: ok, how do I handle HOST1 and HOST2 to make them my new dict starter. These are random hostnames `stupid.host.name` and `idiot.has.no.naming.scheme` are the sections I am looking for. Once I split this, I do I key off of these 2 items to make them the dict name once I split. [SEP] Olevia: Write a program that can show if the series is divergent or convergent [SEP] Olevia: any series** [SEP] Bethany: This is an odd thing to program, unless you're writing a symbolic algebra software [SEP] Bethany: Can yo you paste the question in its entirety? [SEP] Olevia: Yes [SEP] Briana: the data sections of the output are fairly consistent. the header of the output is the actual hostname of one of the connected machines I am pulling the data from. My final output is going to be converting these and outputting the data to a json that is unique for that host containing the data. [SEP] Olevia: But i'm not sure that they want us to write symbolic algebra [SEP] Bethany: I doubt it [SEP] Bethany: Which is why I want to see the whole question exactly as written [SEP] Briana: I am trying to figure out how to split the sections into seperate hosts. On a single run there will be around 1000 of those blocks [SEP] Bethany: We may be missing some info [SEP] Kiera: The easiest way might be to have a \"parent\" dictionary that holds the host dictionaries, keyed off the `HOST` line itself.  That way, as you're looping through, when you find a line that begins with a non-space character, just add that line to the \"parent\" dictionary as the key with a value of a blank dictionary; record either the key, so that subsequent data lines can be added as `parent_dict[host_key][data_key] = data_value`, or record the dictionary itself (`host_dict = {}` // `parent_dict[host_key] = host_dict`) so that subsequent data lines can be added directly into the host dictionary: `host_dict[data_key] = data_value` [SEP] Briana: ok makes sense [SEP] Olevia: Program a program in python language to determine if the sequence is convergent, divergent or has no limits. [SEP] Kiera: this way you'll end up with\n```\n{\n     'HOST1': {\n        'data1': '0',\n        'data2': '10',\n        # \u2026\n    },\n    'HOST2': {\n        # \u2026\n    },\n}\n``` [SEP] Olevia: And the user must be able to put is own sequence [SEP] Bethany: That's it? I'm surprised [SEP] Olevia: I've only that [SEP] Kiera: although, if you're only looking for information about a single host, it _might_ be more efficient to look for that hostname first, then just process that one data block. [SEP] Olevia: A bit hard when you know that i've never used python before that, but it's a very good langage [SEP] Kiera: it depends on whether or not you need to access other hosts later, or otherwise keep accessing or manipulating the overall data set. [SEP] Briana: The data will pull in the output for 1000 hosts. process them into a json, submit the jsons to an api, then quit. [SEP] Briana: no retention will be required, just simply being able to build the array from the dict [SEP] Briana: I don't use all the datapoint. in the end there are actually about 30 for each host, I am going to be pulling 7 [SEP] Bethany: it's odd since those terms only have meaning for infinite sequences [SEP] Bethany: and a user can't input an infinite sequence [SEP] Briana: I appreciate your assistance <@Kiera> [SEP] Olevia: That's why we can set the n time we want to check the sequence [SEP] Bethany: how is the sequence input? [SEP] Bethany: like is the input a list like `[1, 2, 3, 4, ...]` [SEP] Bethany: or is it a mathematical function like `x[n] = 1/n` [SEP] Bethany: apparently if you really want to get pendantic, every finite sequence converges <https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/600795/can-a-sequence-be-called-convergent-divergent-if-it-has-finite-number-of-terms> [SEP] Olevia: I've tried with a list like [1, 2, 3, 4, ...], it's easier, but i think if i want to do a very good function, it should be a mathematical function [SEP] Olevia: I think i will see if it's possible to use finite sequence, it would be much easier to try to develop [SEP] Bethany: yes, it's just fundamentally invalid :stuck_out_tongue: [SEP] Bethany: i think that is closer to what they are looking for though [SEP] Olevia: Thank you for your help <@Bethany> ! That's very appreciate [SEP] Nikki: Anyone know of an API which will take screen grabs of webpages?", "219": "Kiera: this seems fairly straightforward.  First. split the output around newlines, to create a list of lines.  Then loop through each line.  If the line begins with `HOST`, then that tells you which dictionary you're working on.  Otherwise, split the line around `=`; as long as it has 2 fields, strip each field of leading and trailing whitespace and add the resulting key and value into the dictionary you're working on. [SEP] Kiera: what do you mean?", "220": "Shan: Define, screen grabs. [SEP] Shan: Salenium might be your best bet. [SEP] Nikki: Yea, I thought that - as in screenshot [SEP] Shan: Probs selenium then.

Can it be done somehow?\n\nThanks a lot for help! [SEP] Sasha: So, if I understand you, you want to remove python.exe from PATH, but you want any command that uses python.exe to still run as-is? That's pretty much the definition of keeping it in PATH, if it still can run whenever you use it. What's the goal of removing it from PATH, then? [SEP] Brandie: <@Sasha> Yeah, that is kind of an contradiction in itself. The goal is to unify the launch of the python scripts and make it controllable at one place by configuring the launcher.\n\nWith launcher and python.exe in the path it can happen different versions of python are run for\n\n$ python script.py\n\nand\n\nscript.py\n\nAs a solution I see either getting rid of the launcher or python.exe in the PATH.

[SEP] Ashley: <@Roxanne> IMO for python and other languages in general, your biggest enemy will likely be your ability to maintain, rewrite, and extend upon large amounts of code. If you have a giant function, you should break it down anyway, regardless of performance. Whenever you have a slice of code that you can sum up with a simple English phrase, you should break that out into a function where that phrase is the name of the method. That helps compartmentalize your logic (making it easier to think about and debug), makes your code more testable/extensible/maintainable, makes your code document itself, and a whole slew of other benefits.\n\nIIRC even NASA has a rule that a function has to be short enough to fit on one screen without scrolling (NASA also uses Python, which is awesome!).\n\nDo you lose performance when doing this? In Python, technically, yes, but it's negligible (compiled languages can often optimize so this doesn't impact performance, anyway). [SEP] Roxanne: my trade off was basically having to :\n1. Keep in self a big list of dictionaries (up to 20 mbs)\n2. Do 3 `for` iteartions in separated methods instead of 1  (process_telemetry, process_match_scores, process_players_scores)\n\nBut actually makes sense if I end up, for instance, having better control of test or using async requests", "274": "Roxanne: what do you mean with mixed concerns ?", "275": "Mercy: Hi guys by using flask app in my dB I\u2019ve got a student data such as attendance and marks in front end if a user types his number the result will be display like you\u2019re eligible for scholarship how to write using flask [SEP] Hiroko: what is your question, <@Mercy>?

[SEP] Malena: I think request sockets need to have the hostname specified. The zeromq client example has it:\n<http://zguide.zeromq.org/cpp:hwclient> [SEP] Malena: IIRC it's also something to do with the difference between `connect` and `bind`. [SEP] Malena: Actually yeah, that makes sense. You'e making a request socket, so it ought to be making a connection to a single reply host.

[SEP] Lawanna: Nope, latency and and requests, seem pretty normal [SEP] Hiroko: agreed [SEP] Lawanna: I am logging queries yes [SEP] Hiroko: since the scheduler is db backed, I\u2019m curious whether it actually executed the query [SEP] Hiroko: if so, it narrows down whether the failure happened before or after the db was checked [SEP] Lawanna: Then we would see a dip during that time no? The scheduler should have checked atleast a couple of times within that 2 hour period, because about 3 tasks were missed within that period [SEP] Arturo: ah actually there was a slight problem, it was to do with 'lte' not being the complete string, do you think I should use regex to get it?

[SEP] Hiroko: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14849293/python-find-index-position-in-list-based-of-partial-string> [SEP] Lawanna: The first one is total requests, and 3rd is latency.

If I implemented this scheduler, then for sure, this investigation makes sense. But this is a library and I am at the mercy of its own implementation and bugs. Unfortunately, based on the number of issues piling up, its not very well supported.\n\nBased on this awful performance on the first day, I might have to go back to the crude loop. [SEP] Hiroko: the primary advantage of django-celery-beat is the django admin integration [SEP] Hiroko: do you need that? [SEP] Lawanna: I would have thought its also the models and the structure it setups to have the scheduler based on the DB, run by beat. [SEP] Lawanna: I don't use the admin too much, I look it at every now and then to check for schedule times [SEP] Lawanna: and to verify if that task should have fired [SEP] Hiroko: :thumbsup: [SEP] Lawanna: This is a core part of my app, so if you have another other suggestions for schedulers I am all for it.

My work load is not too crazy, compared to have I heard from other teams and read online. I'm currently curing celery beat with django-celery-beat (<https://github.com/celery/django-celery-beat>) so that I can have my tasks managed by the DB (postgres). This allows users to change schedules dynamically.\n\nThis past weekend I did a upgrade of my codebase from py2 to py3, and I switched from huey to celery and use native celery beat to handle scheduling.\nPreviously, I was doing a dumb loop to check for scheduled in a task that fired every minute.\n\nI know... its not great but here is what I did.\n```\n#run every minute\ndef conditionally_run_other_tasks():\n    # query database and see if some tasks should be run.\n    # call the tasks in here and they will be enqueued and executed\n```\n\nHence why I was really glad to move away from that. Having said that though, that little loop only missed a beat a couple of times a month.\n\nI deployed celery yesterday and it has already missed about 5 tasks out of 40.

Are you on the most recent stable versions of everything (django, celery, django-celery-beat)? [SEP] Clemmie: Also are the tasks missed, or do you see a message in your redis log that they were dispatched but didn\u2019t run?

Would an assembly program produced using the Mac computer run on the HP computer? (edited)\nI think it would be yes, but not sure about the OS\nI wonder if the OS can affect to assembly [SEP] Sasha: The actual assembly instructions would be basically the same, but in practice you're probably going to run into problems with the executable format, for instance... a Windows .EXE and a MacOS .APP will be different for the OS to load and run them. [SEP] Sasha: And of course almost anything the program does will need to involve system calls for input and output, etc. [SEP] Sau: hmm [SEP] Sau: interesting [SEP] Sau: so I guess I can run assembly on different OS as long as I have the same CPU [SEP] Hiroko: Agreed. If your just doing register and accumulator arithmetic, yes the code will be portable. But you would need the os to execute the asm code  [SEP] Hiroko: And that would require os specific compilation.  [SEP] Hiroko: If you're thinking of doing osx and Linux, I think the chances of more portability are greater, since osx is a Unix based system  [SEP] Hiroko: Windows, however, is definitely most certainly not a Unix system  [SEP] Sau: so <@Hiroko> the assembly code is still portable however I don\u2019t know why the executable format be the problem. As long as the code runs and compiles and computes what I want it to do, then would it be good to go ? [SEP] Hiroko: You can try it  [SEP] Hiroko: But I doubt it [SEP] Hiroko: Because the asm code is just a small part of the problem  [SEP] Hiroko: The way programs are executed is very different between operating systems  [SEP] Sau: ah I see [SEP] Sau: if your theory is right, then the Executable format will not make the AS code to be running on different OS [SEP] Kiera: specifically, the way programs are *loaded* by the OS into memory, with the memory manager set up for the address space.  also, most programs don't really have much effect if they can't do I/O or interact at all, and that's going to require invoking kernel functions, which can be wildly different between OSes. [SEP] Sasha: The \"compile\" part is where you need to specify to compile into _what_... an EXE, an ELF, etc. [SEP] Sau: so pretty much the OS is hugely affecting the way of the Assembly code can run. [SEP] Hiroko: How else can it be? [SEP] Sau: I guess that is it . The only thing that I concern is to have the same Assembly code running on Mac and Windows [SEP] Sau: I have all of them running on x86 the same CPU [SEP] Hiroko: You can try but I seriously doubt you'll come close to success  [SEP] Hiroko: Cpu architecture is just a small part of what you're working with  [SEP] Sau: I see [SEP] Sasha: I think the function calling conventions for register use might even be different. [SEP] Hiroko: Essentially <@Sau> you have to compile per operating system you want to run on. The differences are too drastic to expect one compile to run on another system  [SEP] Hiroko: I mean, even rollercoaster tycoon, which was 99% x86 asm, had to be compiled for the different platforms it was released for  [SEP] Hiroko: &gt;&gt;&gt;Sawyer wrote 99% of the code for RollerCoaster Tycoon in x86 assembly language, with the remaining one percent written in C.[2] The graphics were designed by artist Simon Foster using several 3D modeling, rendering, and paint programs.[2] For his efforts, Sawyer made around $30 million in revenue.[4] The Xbox port was handled by Frontier Developments, who would later go on to develop later titles in the series.

[SEP] Claudine: ahh [SEP] Claudine: check out the `with` syntax for reading line by line [SEP] Claudine: ```\nwith open('filename.txt) as file:\n    for line in file:\n        print line\n``` [SEP] Claudine: that'll parse your file line by line [SEP] Claudine: instead of `print line` just do a substring match [SEP] Claudine: ```\nwith open('filename.txt) as file:\n    for line in file:\n        if 'WORD' in line:\n            #the word exists in this line, and thus the file\n``` [SEP] Claudine: you can do your processing withing that if statement, or set a flag saying you found the word and then do your processing outside of that whole thing [SEP] Kiera: <@Coleen> your attempt (`if 'WORD' in open('example.txt').read():`) would work, but has the drawback of having to load the entire file into memory at once, then doing a string search over the entire file.  <@Claudine>\u2019s solution does the search line by line, both reducing memory usage and speeding the process up by only reading up to the point where you've found [a line with] the word. [SEP] Sasha: Note that both approaches are just substring matches, so would also flag \"Edword\", etc. If you want whole-word matches, you want <@Claudine>\u2019s expertise in regexes.  :grin: [SEP] Claudine: Indeed REGEX would do it ", "362": "Coleen: And if I want to do it line-by line but starting from the end of the file?

So basically the way I want to use it is:\n```\nMyData['zero']['excited'].method() \n``` [SEP] Coleen: The backstory is that I use a nested dict so far, and I want to add some methods to it. [SEP] Coleen: The dict is\n```\nMYDATA = { # mapping from executable names to what they represent\n    'zero' : {\n        'ground' : 'dish',\n        'excited' : 'ztes'\n    },\n    'finite' : {\n        'ground' : 'skys',\n        'excited' : 'ftes' \n    }\n}\n``` [SEP] Coleen: Why not learn both at the same time: <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html> [SEP] Chester: <@Coleen> what kinds of methods? [SEP] Coleen: Yea so for example the kind of stuff I'm doing with the nested dict right now:\n```\n    # check if input files are present in the workspace\n    for temp in ('zero', 'finite'):\n        for state, suffix in zip(('ground', 'excited'), (\"_dis.dat\", \"_start.dat\")):\n            fpath = os.path.join(args.workspace, CODE_NAME[temp][state] + suffix)\n            if not os.path.isfile(fpath):\n                sys.exit(f\"{fpath} not found, exiting.\")\n``` [SEP] Coleen: There could be a method `input_file()` which returns the corresponding file name, ie `MyData['zero']['ground'].input_file()` would return `dish_dis.dat`, [SEP] Coleen: Not sure it's the right abstraction, but something like this is what I had in mind. [SEP] Coleen: Then another method `MyData.all_input_files()` would return a list containing all input file names: [`dish_dis,dat`, `skys_dis,dat`, `ztes_start.dat`, `ftes_start.dat`] [SEP] Coleen: Or `MyData['zero'].input_files()` would return  `[dish_dis,dat, ztes_start.dat]` and\n`MyData['ground'].input_files()` would return `[dish_dis,dat, skys_dis,dat]` [SEP] Coleen: Does it make sense? [SEP] Chester: That syntax is possible due to dynamic nature of python, but I would advise to implement a more common api:\ninstead of `MyData['zero']['ground'].input_file()` do `MyData.input_file('zero', 'ground')` [SEP] Chester: Same for `MyData['zero'].input_files()`: do `MyData.input_files('zero')` instead [SEP] Coleen: I see. [SEP] Coleen: And I would store the nested dict inside the class right? [SEP] Chester: Yes [SEP] Chester: ```\nclass MyData:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self._data = data\n    def input_file(self, first, second):\n        return self._data[first][second] + '_dis.dat'\n```\nSomething like that. [SEP] Coleen: :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Chester: Btw, there is nothing wrong with not having methods on your `MyData` class and write functions instead, that operate on dictionaries [SEP] Coleen: what do you mean? [SEP] Chester: ```\ndef input_file(data, first, second):\n    return data[first][second] + '_dis.dat'\n``` [SEP] Chester: Where `data` is your dictionary [SEP] Coleen: Oh you mean not writing a class at all [SEP] Chester: Exactly [SEP] Coleen: But I feel the dict and these functions belong together. [SEP] Chester: Maybe, maybe not - you can always refactor a bunch of functions into a class later. [SEP] Coleen: And since the nested dict was a global constant before, should I make this class a singleton? [SEP] Chester: Extracting methods from classes, on the other hand, may be difficult because of uncontrollable implicit dependencies on `self` [SEP] Chester: You see, singletons are a thing in java, but in python there is nothing wrong with a regular global variable :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Chester: Because of how imports work in python, you get singleton behavior out of the box [SEP] Coleen: Yes, but if the variable becomes a class? [SEP] Chester: You'll need to instantiate it somewhere, yeah. `my_data = MyData()`. And only then you'll be able to call methods on `my_data` [SEP] Coleen: But the problem is I will have to instantiate it at the top level of the module. [SEP] Chester: Why is this a problem? [SEP] Coleen: Because it's used in various functions. [SEP] Coleen: Because it creates a global var. [SEP] Coleen: So I read global constants are OK in Python, but not global vars? [SEP] Chester: Uhm [SEP] Chester: There are no constants in python [SEP] Ashley: <@Coleen> global constants are fine in Python because they are unchanging, hence the name \"constant\", but global variables are a code smell (usually) because things in multiple parts of your code migght depend on those things and have to change them, but you can't know which parts will do so, or when they'll do it, so it opens you up to a whole mess of problems [SEP] Ashley: <@Chester> is right that there are no constants in python [SEP] Ashley: but you can create objects that you treat as constants [SEP] Ashley: and that's fine [SEP] Coleen: how [SEP] Ashley: you'll see that commonly done to avoid things like \"magic numbers\" [SEP] Coleen: by giving them a name in capitals? :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Ashley: you just create an object in the global namespace of a module like any other [SEP] Chester: Yes. A capitalized variable doesn't differ from a non-capitalized variable. [SEP] Ashley: all-caps names are a good indicator to othhers that they are constants, and you should definitely do that [SEP] Ashley: but what makes them ok is how they are meant to be used [SEP] Coleen: but if someone else takes my code and he doesn't know how this class is meant to be used? [SEP] Ashley: for example, if I create this: `NY_TAX_RATE = 0.0725`, that's fine [SEP] Ashley: that's why you make  them all caps [SEP] Ashley: because it tells other developers that they shouldn't change those things [SEP] Ashley: similarly, python doesn't have private attributes [SEP] Chester: <@Coleen> to solve that particular problem, we write docstrings for classes, methods and functions. In these docstrings we show examples and explain how this class/method/function should be used [SEP] Ashley: but we try to tell other developers when we want them to treat an attribute as private by starting it with a `_`, e.g. `_super_secret_thing` [SEP] Ashley: that too [SEP] Coleen: :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Ashley: the abstractions were written because you wanted your code to be easy to use [SEP] Ashley: if people are finding it easier to use your \"private\" attributes than the other things meant for that, then you either didn't make something easy to use, or you didn't document it sufficiently enough [SEP] Ashley: on a related note, the bit about global objects that aren't constants being a code smell is what <@Chester> was saying regarding \"singleton behavior out of the box\".

In addition, chances are Andrei will come across a similar issue or one in which Jinja is being used, so _his_ rampup time for that would be drastically lessened by existing expertise [SEP] Sasha: Fair enough. I just worry about the tendency to use a pneumatic hammer-drill just to hang a picture.  :wink: [SEP] Coleen: In all fairness I would have to use jinja later on for some HTML generation so that's a valid point. [SEP] Hiroko: oh, for sure, and I do as well,  Its a balance, being pragmatic and thinking long term [SEP] Hiroko: but I also feel a half hour or a half day\u2019s effort to apply good practices when working on similar code saves myself alot of swearing at the idiot who did this piece of crap (and I was usually said idiot) [SEP] Jonas: this is the question I really want answering [SEP] Jonas: \"why use requests when we have urllib?\", isn't this the same argument?

Can any of you guys identify why? I can't figure it out [SEP] Sasha: It's problematic to remove an item from a list you're iterating through, which is probably causing one of the 5's to get skipped over. Try using `for n in rolls[:]:` to make a copy of the list. [SEP] Demetrice: I don't really know how to implement this but i'm looking it up now. I think you're right though and my program might be removing the wrong 5, i will probably have to update the one for 1 aswell [SEP] Sasha: Yes, you'd want to change both `for` loops where you're altering the list. [SEP] Sasha: By the way, you can remove all of the `else: pass` clauses, as they don't do anything. An `else` is not required in an `if` statement. [SEP] Demetrice: I tried to be clever and update the remove statement to rolls.remove(n) so the program was sure which one i was talking about. It didn't work which was surprising [SEP] Demetrice: Oh okay thanks. I'll get rid of them now [SEP] Sasha: It'll always remove the first matching value it comes across. [SEP] Sasha: Do you understand the underlying problem? [SEP] Demetrice: Maybe not. But i also don't know how to really use list slicing either [SEP] Demetrice: I think maybe when i iterate through my perimeter it's picking up on a 5 adding the 50 points. but then removing the other 5 so it never adds the second set of 50 points [SEP] Demetrice: But my understanding of the problem might be wrong because if that's the case it should be clarified when i told it to remove n instead of 5. but that didn't fix it. [SEP] Sasha: Imagine there's a line of people, and you're a ticket-taker, walking along and punching their tickets one by one. Now, when you're not looking carefully, someone steps out of a line, and everyone moves forward. Wait... whose ticket have you punched, and who do you still have to do? [SEP] Sasha: That's what removing an item from a list does if you're iterating over it at the time... the `for` gets confused about which item it's on, since the one it was working on just disappeared, and everyone else scooted forward, so the 3rd item is now the 2nd, etc. [SEP] Demetrice: I don't know if i'm thinking about it too literally, but wouldn't that depend on who it was that stepped out of line? [SEP] Demetrice: Okay, okay. I think i get that [SEP] Sasha: Very true. If someone at the back of the line left, it's no problem, since you haven't gotten there yet. [SEP] Demetrice: So i don't fully understand it yet, and this is likely of no surprise to you. But implementing your suggestions caused the code to work [SEP] Demetrice: I now have this.

That's another problem. The `in` syntax doesn't work like that. You're asking \"is the list `[1, 1, 1]` an element of the list `rolls`\"? And it isn't. [SEP] Sasha: What exactly are you trying to check there? [SEP] Demetrice: What i'm really trying to ask is does the list rolls contain 3 1's? And if it does add 1000 points to score [SEP] Demetrice: and remove the 3 1's so they can't be counted again for more points [SEP] Demetrice: It's a test case for the python koans i'm trying to work through [SEP] Demetrice: # Greed is a dice game where you roll up to five dice to accumulate\n# points.  The following \"score\" function will be used calculate the\n# score of a single roll of the dice.\n#\n# A greed roll is scored as follows:\n#\n# * A set of three ones is 1000 points\n#\n# * A set of three numbers (other than ones) is worth 100 times the\n#   number. (e.g. three fives is 500 points).\n#\n# * A one (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 100 points.\n#\n# * A five (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 50 points.\n#\n# * Everything else is worth 0 points.\n#\n#\n# Examples:\n#\n# score([1,1,1,5,1]) =&gt; 1150 points\n# score([2,3,4,6,2]) =&gt; 0 points\n# score([3,4,5,3,3]) =&gt; 350 points\n# score([1,5,1,2,4]) =&gt; 250 points\n#\n# More scoring examples are given in the tests below:\n#\n# Your goal is to write the score method. [SEP] Demetrice: This is what i'm trying to write [SEP] Sasha: You'll need to do something more complicated for that logic, unfortunately. [SEP] Sasha: Have a look at `collections.Counter`. [SEP] Demetrice: I was concerned i might have been on the wrong track [SEP] Demetrice: It's a little past 1 am here and i have to be up sorta early tomorrow [SEP] Demetrice: You're saying i need to research what a collection counter is in python and it might help me solve this problem? [SEP] Sasha: That's a particular library which is used to count how many things you have of different values. You don't need to use it, and in fact I'd encourage you to implement things from scratch if this is a learning exercise, but it would be a fast way to implement this logic. [SEP] Demetrice: Yeah it's supposed to be for learning so i think ideally i'm supposed to struggle this much. I looked it up and i thought the if  test_values in list: [SEP] Demetrice: Format would work, but i'm disappointed it's not having the desired result [SEP] Sasha: You can do `if 1 in [1, 2, 3]`, but lists only check for one matching element, not groups of them. [SEP] Demetrice: So then maybe i need to iterate before the if statement to get the desired result [SEP] Demetrice: This is gonna be really round about but it might work [SEP] Sasha: My advice would be to maybe think in terms of a useful data structure. [SEP] Demetrice: I'm not sure what you mean by that [SEP] Demetrice: I tried to do it this way. It's really really dirty but it also ended up not working [SEP] Demetrice: def score(dice):\n    # You need to write this method\n    rolls = []\n    score = 0\n    count1 = 0\n    count2 = 2\n    for n in dice:\n        rolls.append(n)\n    for n in rolls:\n        if n == 1:\n            count1 += 1\n    if count1 == 3:\n        score += 1000\n        rolls.remove[1,1,1]\n    if [2,2,2] in dice:\n        score += 200\n    if [3,3,3] in dice:\n        score += 300\n    if [4,4,4] in dice:\n        score += 400\n    if [5,5,5] in dice:\n        score += 500\n        rolls.remove(5,5,5)\n    for n in rolls:\n        if n == 5:\n            score += 50\n    for n in rolls:\n        if n == 1:\n            score += 100\n    return score [SEP] Demetrice: Now i'm getting an error message about  TypeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object is not subscriptable [SEP] Demetrice: I think i did something i shouldn't have [SEP] Sasha: It's the `remove` call using brackets. [SEP] Sasha: So this is a decent step. It's obviously useful to have a count value for how many 1's you have. Would it be useful to have count values for every dice value? [SEP] Demetrice: Right it was supposed to be parenthesis [SEP] Demetrice: Yes it would. So i think i'm nearing the end of this [SEP] Demetrice: My code is going to be really ugly [SEP] Demetrice: But i was able to pass the test for the 3 1's [SEP] Demetrice: But you're right it's not going to work for everything else. So i need to copy that format and use it for all the other ones [SEP] Demetrice: But it's going to be really ugly and inefficient.

I then use these recorded numbers in the return [SEP] Lamont: My current thinking is that, while it passes the provided test case, it may be stalling during the while loop \u201cwhile n &gt; 1:\u201c, for an edge case, such as when n is divided multiple consecutive times by a single prime, in the while loop \u201cwhile n % prime == 0:\u201d [SEP] Raven: If you're not sure if it's stalling or not, one first step would be to find out. You could consider adding something like `print(n)` inside the loop.

If you really do need to expand the list as you go along, just calculate from the end onwards [SEP] Lamont: Yeah, I debated putting that \u201cif\u201d statement there but decided on including it, in order to make it easy to break out of the for-loop after n is divided by the given prime number the maximum number of times. This was an attempt to let the algo break out of the for-loop after factoring that prime number out of n [SEP] Lamont: I could do that by converting getPrimes into a generator [SEP] Raven: Ah, I see. I guess it's times like this I wish Python had a do..while loop. [SEP] Raven: Without wanting to disturb things too much, you might also consider a recursive approach, starting with the largest prime smaller than `n` and working downwards until you find an integer factor, and then you can repeat the process for each of those, etc [SEP] Lamont: I was just thinking something along the lines, working from larger to smaller prime factors. Great idea \u2014 I\u2019ll give it a shot now! [SEP] Lamont: Turns out the solution is to just iterate i from 1 to n, checking if n is divisible by i. If it is, include it in the answer.

This is a continuous stream. Tweet volume, sentiment results and such are written to a db each minute. It works - until it doesn't.\n\nWhat happens after a few hours is that the tool continues to write data to my db, but all of the entries have values at 0 (See the image).\n\nI assume what happens is that Twitter shuts off my connection, but they way I have coded this, my app continues to run. I'm unsure how to fix this however. My best guess is that I haven't setup my exception handling correctly. [SEP] Conchita: To the more experienced people on here, can you smell where the issue might be? This is a snippet of my try/except [SEP] Jimmy: do you have any logging output ? [SEP] Conchita: Only whats inside the `try` block, when the initial connection to Twitter happens [SEP] Conchita: ```2019-01-29 17:13:27,744:INFO:Stream connected\n2019-01-29 18:48:21,621:INFO:Stream connected\n2019-01-29 18:55:16,013:INFO:Stream connected\n``` [SEP] Conchita: It does not <@Leida> [SEP] Conchita: Should I add a `continue` in the end of my `except` blocks? [SEP] Leida: you have some exception that falls through the current catching [SEP] Conchita: Or am I not catching the errors [SEP] Conchita: Yeah that could be [SEP] Conchita: How can I catch all, for the purpose of finding it? [SEP] Conchita: Would this work? [SEP] Leida: that would do it [SEP] Leida: only your while loop keeps on going [SEP] Leida: stream.disconnect() disconnects but does stream.filter() connect? [SEP] Conchita: I'm pretty sure it does, but can't be 100% due to lack of proper logging in the past [SEP] Leida: what triggers your db write tho? [SEP] Leida: an uncaught exception would break the while loop and that bit of code stops, if you have some external db write that does the write without regard to whether it has data or not could explain the 0's [SEP] Conchita: I know this is not best practice but the logic is as follow; I use global variables.\n1) These are updated as data is processed\n2)  Then a while loop read those globals and writes to the db\n3) globals are reset\n4) while loop sleeps for x seconds\n5) repeat [SEP] Conchita: None [SEP] Leida: and you have some threading so that you can have two blocking while loops going? [SEP] Conchita: Well, no [SEP] Conchita: I sort of started writing this app two weeks after I starting my programming journey [SEP] Leida: anyway the main point is that an uncaught exception jumps out of your reading while loop and no new data goes into your globals [SEP] Conchita: Full of bad practice and not knowing exactly what I'm doing [SEP] Conchita: Exactly [SEP] Leida: catch the exception that does this and fix the problem [SEP] Conchita: On it [SEP] Leida: try not to keep a catch-all in your code, would add to the list of bad ideas ^^ [SEP] Conchita: Absolutely, only using it now for testing so I can find the ninja exception so I can add it to the small list of specific exceptions [SEP] Conchita: Could you shed some light on threading and why not having it is a bad idea when using two while loops? [SEP] Leida: threading is not a good idea for you right now, so not having it is good :smile: [SEP] Leida: i just cant tell how you can have two blocking while loops going, unless they are nested ^^ [SEP] Conchita: One while loop is inside a function. The second is not. If that answers your Q [SEP] Conchita: None [SEP] Leida: now im confused how it enters any data besides the first time atall :smile: [SEP] Alicia: `There's a way to force conda to download packages only from pypi?`\n\nthis was the question maybe you missed it out [SEP] Leida: you run the script, definitions are loaded and then the code hits if __name__ line which calls main() [SEP] Leida: the main contains an endless loop that wont stop unless some error that you are not catching break it [SEP] Leida: and only then should the writing to database loop start [SEP] Leida: in the while run: bit do you call main() again somewhere? [SEP] Conchita: No [SEP] Conchita: That while loop that starts off at line 32 runs every 60 second [SEP] Conchita: Since the variable `run` is always True, and to the best of my knowledge can't turn False: the while loop will never stop. And in the first line of the while loop it has a sleep statement [SEP] Conchita: That sleep statement has a variable which is set to 60 seconds [SEP] Conchita: Does that make sense or am I missing some core concepts here? [SEP] Leida: the sleep() blocks the thread, this should not enable the other loop to run any further [SEP] Conchita: interesting. Well it does run for quite some time. Sometimes days, sometimes hours [SEP] Conchita: hmmm [SEP] Leida: my initial guess was that your second loop calls main again and that an error that causes it to stop would enable a write to the database, but i dont see that anywhere [SEP] Leida: do you call the script itself in a loop somewhere? [SEP] Conchita: I do not [SEP] Conchita: The last loop in this script is a for loop which is  inside of a class I have, but that deals with sentiment analysis (textblob) and does not call this script [SEP] Valeri: Yeah I got that [SEP] Valeri: I was wondering what lead you into doing this [SEP] Valeri: Maybe if you shared that we could have a better simpler solution? [SEP] Leida: did the last paste of code contain code from multiple sources? [SEP] Conchita: No [SEP] Conchita: All the snippets have been from the same script [SEP] Leida: there is some magic going on that i dont see from the pastes but basically in the `start_stream()` there is an uncaught exception so that the while loop breaks and the global state does not get updated. Since there is a break statement in the successful running of `stream.filter()` means that something needs to call this bit of code over and over [SEP] Leida: what ever the exception is calling `stream.filter()` does not fix it [SEP] Leida: so i would assume the problem is with the authentication becoming invalid [SEP] Valeri: <@Conchita> Why don't you allow your code to break and then figure out what went wrong? [SEP] Valeri: Basically get rid of all the exceptions and see why your code broke [SEP] Valeri: Also, relying on a exceptions to perform tasks is a bad idea imo [SEP] Leida: there is mention of async in the code so that some part may well die while the rest keeps on running [SEP] Valeri: Yeah [SEP] Valeri: Also, why don't you verify your data before writing to the database?

[SEP] Leida: ok so actually there is no exception to catch in `start_stream()` since it probably succeeds first time it is run and since `is_async` is `True` the `stream.filter()` is run on a separate thread [SEP] Leida: the library handles passing of data between threads internally [SEP] Leida: so now i guess the stream is terminated at some point or just blocked from getting any data and there is no exception to catch on the main thread [SEP] Leida: if this is so then the pasted lines of logging would correspond to times of restarting the script [SEP] Leida: so... the error should show up in `stream.listner` by the looks of the tweepy source code", "424": "Leida: does it spam it?", "425": "Valeri: You're probably just being rate limited maybe?", "426": "Hiroko: :facepalm:", "427": "Karoline: hey someone else might have mentioned this (I'm just scrolling through) but there is `logging.exception` which will automatically print the stack trace for you.

I did a ton of research on ssh and figured out that you really can't run executables/batch files over ssh. [SEP] Nenita: at least for windows. seems like linux users were able to get it going [SEP] Clemmie: <@Nenita> that sounds unusual, can you point to resources explaining why? I didn\u2019t think there would be a situation where an OS would differentiate between an \u201clocal\u201d user and an ssh-ed user. Ultimately, at least in *nix they both login to the shell [SEP] Nenita: I can try. but i said that earlier because of testing. i got it working with putty, vm linux, as well as python, but when a script was run say - 'start .' it will execute the command, but nothing happens on either pc, mine or the remote pc. [SEP] Nenita: but let me see if i can find solid sources from my findings [SEP] Nenita: but also when running any script with 'start' at the beginning, putty just hangs [SEP] Nenita: for how long? - don't know. seems forever. [SEP] Leida: i've got an architecture problem to solve:\nI async in udp packets and relay them to a consumer elsewhere. From the packet i need to update internal state to mirror the packet sender to build logic on top of the sender. Since the packets are UDP i cant use streams and have to go lower and implement a protocol. The loop.create_datagram_endpoint() takes a protocol factory. This means i cant hook it up with a connection to the state at init and have to find another method to pass the data.\nSome of my ideas:\nCreate a protocol factory factory that creates the state sharing at init. Seems bit dumb.\nCreate a singleton via an internal state module that has a data sink method for the protocol to use and internal data parsing and what not and another public api for getting the current state. This could do the trick, but singleton...\nAnother idea was to try use rxpy as im familiar with rx on .NET. Havent figured out how to implement it asyncronously and not even sure it needs to be async and which version of the library to use...\nAnother dumb idea is to biggyback on the logging module and do the state mutation via that. Logging internally implements pub sub so it would work but at the cost of being clever with in built libraries that werent meant for that specific task.\nOne more idea is to be a good boy and get state out of the code as the functional way and instead write it to a data storage unit like sqlite or w/e and then create a second program to check the state and execute logic based on that. Since nothing needs to be done in the same second there is no timing constraints. A con is the data read and writes - i would rather have everything on ram. Some ram based database then?\nAnother idea is to make the protocol itself keep the state using what-are-they-called.. class variables? But holding the whole state in something that is a protocol for something else does just not feel right xD [SEP] Leida: i was thinking the same but decided against it as the introduction of the channel mentioned trying not to post stuff that help could deal with [SEP] Leida: ill ask there later i guess ^^ [SEP] Carmen: Okay, so your biggest issue will be carrying over that data between requests. The best way is to just pass around the prediction model ID and always pull the full data from the database when you need it. If they need to modify things, present those fields to the user and use a fields whitelist for processing the update.

Something like \"models dont appear\" is too vague - there are lots of reasons why this could happen. You need to dig into *why* they don't appear, and ask more specific questions. Like, \"why is this model not being displayed even though it is in the database\" [SEP] Nenita: nvm [SEP] Nenita: just tried it. it works, but the same issue is still occuring. it just hangs when certain commands are run [SEP] Cherilyn: actually, the form that I am using the create new instances cannot do the job. I can only create instance via admin panel. Whenever I try to create new new projects via form, it does nothing and redirect me to project list page [SEP] Nenita: and for the commands that don't hang, i.e. opening a bat file - nothing happens still. odd.

I'm not using linux at all. I am using SSH via 2 windows PC's. I can send commands just fine, but commands that are meant to open files or folders do not execute anything on either pc. [SEP] Nenita: I have tried windows SSH and putty and both output the same result [SEP] Mozelle: I thought json.loads treated it like a list so you could use the fields? [SEP] Raven: <@Nenita> SSH just executes commands as if they are being executed locally - it doesn't matter which SSH program you use, generally [SEP] Carmen: Aha. I must have picked up the Ubuntu thing from somewhere else. [SEP] Carmen: Are the commands you're trying to run GUI-based? [SEP] Nenita: putty creates a log file for me so I was able to confirm that packages were sent and received [SEP] Nenita: but it just hangs at receiving packets - per what the log showed [SEP] Jonas: <@Mozelle> it's not telling you the field doesn't exist [SEP] Jonas: it's telling you the variable `items` doesn't exist [SEP] Jonas: just as if you do `foo + blah` [SEP] Jonas: you'd get the same error. [SEP] Nenita: <@Carmen> no just basic commands like 'start' [SEP] Magdalena: Anyone else using VSCode ever have an issue where it will sometimes not pause execution at breakpoints you\u2019ve set? [SEP] Mozelle: This is the output it has would items not be a field? [SEP] Nenita: basic commands that return data work perfectly like their suppose to. It just hangs with certain commands. [SEP] Cherish: <@Nenita> one thing I did learn the hard way, SSH\u2019ing into a Linux environment though (not Windows), is that this didn\u2019t work to run commands that are aliases in the bash profile on the other machine [SEP] Cherish: not sure if that might be what you\u2019re running into [SEP] Carmen: <@Nenita> It honestly sounds like the system is trying to do the thing, but the SSH server doesn't have the appropriate permissions or capabilities to handle whatever the command is supposed to do. [SEP] Nenita: that is the only option i have left to conclude [SEP] Nenita: i was reading that on one post [SEP] Nenita: <@Carmen> [SEP] Carmen: In Linux, I'd think it was related to not having a Windowing system like X available, but I'm not sure how Windows environments handle that sort of thing. [SEP] Mozelle: Ok I get that but I am misunderstanding then. How do I get to the values in the json then? [SEP] Carmen: Plus you have the interaction with the SSH server process trying to start it up, and all the permissions that would involve, as well as then how the SSH server is going to send that back to you. [SEP] Nenita: i think a good option to wing out is to test out ssh from linux to windows and see if these commands execute on my own pc through vm [SEP] Nenita: if it works through vm to my pc, then its concluded that it may be permission based [SEP] Carmen: Out of curosity, what actual programs are you trying to execute with `start`? [SEP] Nenita: just open a folder lol [SEP] Nenita: simplest test to see if the commands affected the remote pc [SEP] Carmen: That sounds like a GUI-based thing, tbh. I'd probably have gone for a Windows equivalent of `touch` though. <https://superuser.com/a/764721> [SEP] Jonas: Using a string. \"key\", not key [SEP] Jonas: this is a <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python> question IMO [SEP] Nenita: im not sure if that's gunna help me get far. ultimate throughout all the trouble i've been accruing, ultimately i just want to be able to run a single bat file just so I have control on my end. [SEP] Jonas: so you might get better help there [SEP] Carmen: Well, you said you were wanting to test if the commands affect the remote PC. That would let you know that you can affect it. If you need to interact with specific programs in specific ways, that's a whole different ballgame. [SEP] Raven: Usually `start` will execute a program in a different window. If you're in an SSH session, you won't see that other window. [SEP] Carmen: And depending on what you're aiming for, you might be better served with using a Windows integration library via Python script. [SEP] Nenita: <@Carmen> oh i see now [SEP] Nenita: good idea. my apologies [SEP] Nenita: any good libraries? [SEP] Carmen: It's been years. Let me grab my Grey Hat Python book and see what he uses, and go from there. [SEP] Kiera: <@Mozelle> the issue is that the key you put in between the `[\u2026]` braces is a python expression.  You're giving an expression of `items` - which means to look up the name `items` in the current symbol table and find the value associated with it.  You haven't defined any name `items`, so it's telling you that the name `items` is not found.  To look up a literal string value as a key, you need to give it a literal string - surrounded by quotes (e.g. `'\u2026'` or `\"\u2026\"`) [SEP] Kiera: so specifically, you should be looking for `test[\"items\"]` [SEP] Mozelle: Thanks, I do not know why I was forgetting the \" [SEP] Mozelle: Yes thanks I do not know why in my mind I had added the \" [SEP] Nenita: <@Raven> yea i was hoping it would execute it on the remote pc. thankfully i am visually remoted in so i can see if anything happens [SEP] Raven: And is this batch file on the remote pc?

[SEP] Carmen: In that case, \"python windows gui automation\" popped up that project as the top result. [SEP] Nenita: right lmao [SEP] Nenita: speaking; do you know if pywinauto is functional over networks? [SEP] Carmen: You'll need to have it installed locally AFAIK. The Python script will need to be locally running as well. [SEP] Nenita: ah shoot [SEP] Carmen: If it's driving GUI stuff, it's going to be making system-level calls, and I don't know of any way to be doing that remotely without *something* running on the target system.

[SEP] Nenita: I appreciate all the help", "433": "Ashley: <@Nenita> I'm coming in late and didn't read everything, but with SSH, you're basically operating entirely on the machine you \"SSH'd\" into. So when you SSH into a linux machine, you're limited to a linux environment, so you can't run .bat files, because those are windows only [SEP] Ashley: also, if you write a .bat script that SSH's into a linux machine for you, it won't run the commands in the .bat script after the SSH command until after the SSH command is done running, which means killing the SSH connection [SEP] Jonas: `print(form.save())`", "434": "Carmen: <@Nenita> Summary version of your issues so far, so that we're all on the same page (please correct something I get wrong here):\n\u2022 You're trying to SSH into a Windows box from an Ubuntu box.\n\u2022 You want to execute a batch file on the Windows box via the SSH connection.\n\u2022 You can connect just fine, but the batch file fails.\n\u2022 Certain commands within the batch file fail, but not all of them.", "435": "Granville: Does anyone know if there's a point where you would use a nested function over a class? [SEP] Ashley: decorators [SEP] Ashley: classes are good for when you need to keep track of the state of some data and need functionality that's dependent on that data's state [SEP] Hiroko: Or if you want a custom handler for a callback.  Like in the pybreaker circuit breaker library  [SEP] Ashley: that too [SEP] Ashley: sometimes you just want the ability to create a one-off function that you can change a little bit about without going through the hassle of making a class with callable instances [SEP] Raven: I would argue that unless you explicitly have a package of state _and_ operations that operate primarily on that state alone, you shouldn't have a class [SEP] Raven: I think Java has a lot to answer for, with the \"everything should be a class\" attitude it created [SEP] Ashley: yeah, not a bad argument [SEP] Ashley: haha I agree [SEP] Hiroko: ```    def call_api_many(self, url, param_sets=None, max_workers=settings.INDEXING_MAX_THREADS):\n        max_workers = util.clamp(max_workers, 2, settings.INDEXING_MAX_THREADS)\n        timeout = self.timeout\n        with FuturesSession(session=self, max_workers=max_workers) as fsession:\n            def validate_response(session, response):\n                if response.status_code == requests.codes.ok:\n                    response.data = response.json()\n                elif response.status_code == requests.codes.not_found:\n                    response.data = None\n                else:\n                    response.raise_for_status()\n\n            futures = [\n                fsession.get(url, params=params, timeout=timeout, background_callback=validate_response)\n                for params in param_sets\n            ]\n\n        for future in futures:\n            yield future``` [SEP] Hiroko: that\u2019s inside a class, so you can see there\u2019s a defined method inside the context [SEP] Hiroko: so, the seesion executes, and the callback executes when complete.  It just updates the data [SEP] Hiroko: `FuturesSession` comes from `requests_futures` [SEP] Hiroko: so that allows a bulk broadcast call to execute over a number of workers to different services, and act as a generator [SEP] Hiroko: ```            futures = self.call_api_many(url, param_sets=param_sets, max_workers=page_count)\n\n            for future in futures:\n                data = future.result().data\n                chapters.extend(util.deserialize_many(\n                    ChapterSerializer, data.get('results', []), book_data=book_data,\n                    context={'extra_meta': extra_meta},\n                ))``` [SEP] Hiroko: so in this case, `validate_response` has just one thing to do, and its used in one place only [SEP] Hiroko: so it makes sense to have it as a nested function inside a context manager [SEP] Raven: I think that's another good point - nested functions (and classes) mean you can avoid polluting the global namespace with things that aren't going to get used outside of a specific context [SEP] Hiroko: precisely, and for my purposes, that\u2019s pretty much the primary usage [SEP] Carmen: True, but isn't that what namespaces in general are supposed to handle? [SEP] Hiroko: I use inheritance and composition alot, which means mixins and base classes.  and this usage pattern tends to clean things up a bit more and increase understandability [SEP] Carmen: I was trying to come up with an equivalent of \"related function aggregation\" as per Scala objects, but really, namespaces should do that AFAIK.

[SEP] Sylvie: I took the path from the error and plopped it in there and it's throwing more errors :expressionless: [SEP] Jonas: I would take a look at some of the suggestions above and see if they help [SEP] Raven: Show the errors [SEP] Raven: (and the new code) [SEP] Sylvie: I'm trying them as much as I can [SEP] Sylvie: I'm looking where I can add the suggestions [SEP] Jonas: Your code is running in the wrong directory. Have a look for an input box called \"working directory\" inside visual studio code [SEP] Sylvie: None [SEP] Jonas: I'm not familiar with that editor so I do not know where it is [SEP] Jonas: if you add the print statement like I suggested, we could fix this by making the path relative to that [SEP] Ashley: it looks like vs code [SEP] Raven: Right [SEP] Raven: That error is saying that it's confused about your string used for a path name... it probably has a `\\u` in it (e.g. `\\users`) and that starts to look like a special Unicode character, to Python [SEP] Sylvie: It seems like it looks at the path error and just quits the code. [SEP] Raven: Swap the backslashes `\\` for forward slashes `/` and try again [SEP] Raven: Yes, it will stop as soon as it hits the first error. [SEP] Raven: (There's some other way to get Python to ignore the backslashes, but I forget what it is. Perhaps an `r` prefix. Maybe someone else can comment?)

If `a.foo` creates a large dictionary, people often write [SEP] Genesis: interesting [SEP] Jonas: `something, something2 = a.foo['x'], a.foo['y']` [SEP] Jonas: so you're calling `foo` twice and creating two large dictionaries only to throw them away [SEP] Genesis: ya, I would find it very very weird, for me, that `a.foo != a.foo` [SEP] Genesis: why make it a property and not just a method?

The answer i posted should help you. With SSH you log in to the windows machine so even the linux to windows examples are valid - you are running the actual commands on the windows machine. You say that opening a folder does not work but SSH is not a GUI enabled system by default. If you try to open something like file explorer then it wont show on the screen of the windows machine because it is opened in the background by a user that has no GUI. To really open a folder you use `cd` which works on both windows and linux. If you really need to open some graphical interfaces you are better off with loging in  to the machine with RDP or some tool like TeamViewer. And if you are hell bent on SSH to do work with GUI tools you need to set the gui to run with in a user that has access to GUI and set the correct access rights and accept eula and what not. The answers you find that SSH from linux should work exactly the same as SSH from windows to windows.

Thanks <@Valeri> &amp; <@Sasha> :taco::taco: [SEP] Leida: Your code dips into using threads. Threads are like different dimensions for data processing. In one the data grabbing is done, in the other the processing and saving. The problem with threads is passing data between them. You can have problems where two different threads try to write or read the same data and the outcome is never good. For you the library you use is pretty good and hides those problems from you. So in general you dont need to know much about threads to get the job done. The magic i was looking for is exactly that it seemed there to be code that would take the whole thread to do work and not allow the other part to work but somehow it did. Reading about the library in use cleared my confusion - there is a separate thread for its work. [SEP] Leida: It seems to me that the stream not only returns you the values it grabbed off twitter but also sends you all the errors that happend on the other thread. For debugging you should figure out how to read the errors the stream sends you. Your solution of simply restarting the stream may well be the only option even if you knew what the error was. Only problem is that you try to reconnect for ever even if the error is that you no longer have internet connection or something similar.

[SEP] Hiroko: so, the first bit, `class SpaceAge` [SEP] Hiroko: the parameter for that is for anything that class should inherit from a parent class [SEP] Hiroko: lets say you have\n\n```class Shape(object):\n    # methods here\n\nclass Circle(Shape):\n    # methods here that can ovveride methods in Shape\n``` [SEP] Hiroko: so, lets say you want to have a method `area` in `Shape\n\n```class Shape(object):\n    def area(self):\n        raise NotImplementedError('Shape doesn't define a default implementation of area')\n\nclass Circle(Shape):\n    def __init__(self, diameter):\n         self.diameter = diameter\n    def area(self):\n        return (math.pi / 4) * math.pow(self.diameter, 2)\n``` [SEP] Hiroko: so, you can do ```s = Shape()``` [SEP] Hiroko: but if you do `s.area()`, you\u2019ll get your error, because it explifictly raises the not implemented error [SEP] Hiroko: however, if you do ```c = Circle(2947)\nc.area()  # outputs 6821033.038``` [SEP] Hiroko: so, for your example, you can remove `e_seconds` from `SpaceAge` [SEP] Hiroko: its already a parameter for your init, so you pass it in like\n\n```s_a = SpaceAge(8376456)\ns_a.jupiter()  # calls the method\n``` [SEP] Hiroko: but with your existing definiton, it doesn\u2019t do anything [SEP] Hiroko: remember, methods have scope.  so if you\u2019re defining a variable inside a method, that method isn\u2019t available outside.  so, calling `jupiter` above just has `j_seconds` available inside that method with no way to access it [SEP] Hiroko: because you haven\u2019t done `return seconds * 11.862615` [SEP] Leopoldo: <@Hiroko> that is a lot for me to digest, I\u2019ll give it some thought and thank you for the help! [SEP] Hiroko: yes, OOP is pretty difficult to grasp your head around at times [SEP] Hiroko: and there are times you\u2019re just too confused to articulate the question that you\u2019re confused with :smile: [SEP] Leopoldo: I very much feel like that right now [SEP] Hiroko: been there, done that :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Leopoldo: lol thank you [SEP] Hiroko: what might help is to think of `class ...` as a blueprint [SEP] Hiroko: it contains the stuff to create the thing you want and the behavior you deem necessary [SEP] Hiroko: and instances, eg, `c = SpaceAge(...)`, just follow that blueprint [SEP] Leopoldo: Could you make it even simpler for me. What goes in the first parenthesis of Class SpaceAge(?) [SEP] Leopoldo: And where does that (?) need to be defined? [SEP] Hiroko: it defines what things that class should have by default [SEP] Hiroko: if nothing is specified, or the params are omitted, it just inherits from `object`, which is the base python class [SEP] Hiroko: look at my example above with Shape and Circle [SEP] Hiroko: we want Circle to have the properties of Shape, because a circle is a shape, right? [SEP] Hiroko: it has area, boundaries, color, etc [SEP] Hiroko: so you can define those properties in Shape, and have Circle say \u201chey, no need to rewrite all that code, I can just pull it in for myself\u201d [SEP] Leopoldo: Hmm ok that makes sense. [SEP] Hiroko: so, each class has a constructor, and in puython, thats the `__init__(self)` method [SEP] Hiroko: now, `self` is an explicit way for you to refer to a specific instance of a class [SEP] Leopoldo: ok I understand so far [SEP] Hiroko: you know, just like you can have a whole bunch of M&amp;Ms in your hands, doesn\u2019t [SEP] Hiroko: one can be green, another can be red, etc [SEP] Hiroko: each M&amp;M is an instance of a class, if you will [SEP] Clemmie: <@Leopoldo> This is a pretty good introduction to object oriented programming concepts <https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/object-oriented-programming-explained/> [SEP] Leopoldo: ok <@Hiroko> makes sense. I get a little confused where things are being defined and where to apply those. [SEP] Leopoldo: But I\u2019m getting a little more of an understanding. [SEP] Carmen: To be slightly more explicit about the the first line of the class definition, `class SpaceAge(?)`, putting something where the `?` is is optional. That slot is where you say, \"This class that I'm defining inherits it's methods and attributes from this other class\". It's a way to reuse code without having to violate the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). By inheriting from another class, you can rely on that class to define everything it does, and then you just modify the things that you need to act differently in yours. [SEP] Carmen: You can inherit from multiple other classes, just separating those class names from each other with a comma, and it will give you all the attributes and methods from each of them. [SEP] Carmen: If you don't inherit from another class explicitly, the system will say your class inherits from the built-in Object class. [SEP] Leopoldo: That is really helpful <@Carmen> I wouldn\u2019t enter anything there unless I want it inherited from another class [SEP] Carmen: Precisely. [SEP] Leopoldo: Can I inherit a value from a variable? Like my e_seconds? Or would I need to create another class with that value? [SEP] Hiroko: you can inherit from classes or methods [SEP] Carmen: No, because your variable is not a class. It's an instance of a class (in your case, an integer). [SEP] Hiroko: but that;s a distinction that really doesn\u2019t matter at this point [SEP] Carmen: Ooo, method inheritance is something new for me. *Googles* [SEP] Hiroko: look for mixins [SEP] Leopoldo: ok <@Hiroko> <@Carmen> [SEP] Leopoldo: thank you both [SEP] Carmen: Oooooh, you're talking about overriding previously defined methods, yes? [SEP] Hiroko: or adding in new ones that really don\u2019t belong to a specific class [SEP] Carmen: Aha. Then yes, I'm familiar with that. I just hadn't ever heard of it described as inheriting from a method. [SEP] Hiroko: ah, gotcha [SEP] Hiroko: you can do it both, from class or from method [SEP] Carmen: Can you toss me an example link? My google-fu isn't coming up with what I think you're talking about. [SEP] Hiroko: damn, could have sworn i had a link to function mixin [SEP] Hiroko: but no, mixins are a simple class [SEP] Carmen: Hm. Perhaps something in an older version of Python? [SEP] Clemmie: I think you can inherit from anything, but your MRO stack may get confused. I mean by default it inherits from `object` and everything is an object, right? [SEP] Carmen: This sounds like a job for some experimentation. [SEP] Carmen: ```def some_function():\n    pass\n\n\nclass SomeClass(some_function):\n    pass``` [SEP] Clemmie: `TypeError: function() argument 1 must be code, not str` [SEP] Carmen: Exactly that. [SEP] Carissa: Hello everyone, I have one query that\ndid python through error ``` ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package ``` , if i still have ``` __init__.py ``` file in directory.

[SEP] Ashley: it updates the `calyear` dict to also have the stuff from `prgmcode` [SEP] Granville: <@Ashley> I see that part, but wouldn't the return fail on the first `if` statement and return nothing? [SEP] Ashley: to put that in other words, they can be mutable types, and the default value is hardcoded by reference, so it's the same `[]` object every time you call that function [SEP] Ashley: nope [SEP] Hiroko: no, because you have an `else` [SEP] Ashley: because `year` isn't Falsey [SEP] Hiroko: that\u2019s a catch-all in case all others fail [SEP] Granville: ah, so I have it backwards then [SEP] Ashley: it returns from `elif not code:` [SEP] Agustina: he\u2019s saying that the calyear variable content are updated IN PLACE\u2026 it doesn\u2019t return a new value like an immutable object does. [SEP] Ashley: ^ [SEP] Agustina: so the `if` conditions are working fine, but the object you\u2019re returning has been changed [SEP] Ashley: technically, it returns `None` from `update` [SEP] Ashley: because everything returns `None` by default [SEP] Ashley: so `combined` is `None` [SEP] Agustina: true, so the value of `combined` is None, but the value of `calyear` has been changed by the update method call.. [SEP] Ashley: correct [SEP] Agustina: I missed that when I first read the sample code, good catch <@Ashley> [SEP] Ashley: sorry, didn't mean to mislead [SEP] Ashley: also, for styling notes, you should put spaces around the `=` when assigning to a variable, but not when passing or defining keyword arguments to/for a function [SEP] Ashley: <@Granville> is this Python 3? [SEP] Granville: <@Ashley> it is [SEP] Ashley: cool, one sec [SEP] Granville: thanks all. I'll take a look at this a bit further. I've never done something this way, so I may need to go back and do some tweaking until I get things right [SEP] Ashley: <@Granville> here's a fixed up version. Take a look at the `**` operator. You can probably use it to eliminate this function entirely [SEP] Ashley: the `*` and `**` operators are also super handy in general, so you'll benefit from learning them [SEP] Ashley: forr what to google, you can look for \"packing\" and \"unpacking\" [SEP] Granville: <@Ashley> Thanks! Ah, I was supposed to have a return regardless. [SEP] Ashley: <@Granville> usually if the only thing that would go in your `else` is just a `return`, you don't need the else, and can just put it in normally [SEP] Agustina: except that str(None) is \u2018None\u2019 so your variables will ALWAYS be populated. [SEP] Ashley: `year` won't be [SEP] Ashley: or `code` [SEP] Ashley: they'd both still be `None` [SEP] Agustina: ah\u2026 sorry, you\u2019re right\u2026 I need to stop switching languages and drink more coffee\u2026 [SEP] Ashley: However, you did make me think of a better approach [SEP] Agustina: I like it\u2026 easier to read. [SEP] Chester: You can also consider to return an empty dictionary instead of `None` if `year` and `code` aren't specified [SEP] Chester: So this snippet is simplified to just\n```\ndef queries(year=None, code=None):\n    response = {}\n    if year:\n        respone[\"Year\"] = str(year)\n    if code:\n        respone[\"code\"] = str(code)\n    return response\n``` [SEP] Ashley: <@Chester> yeah, that would be better. It's still falsey and has a consistent data type [SEP] Ashley: also less code [SEP] Micki: Any help for the state transitions [SEP] Chester: Also raises the question why do you need this as a function :slightly_smiling_face: It's pretty dumb (in its current form) to hide some complexity (there is no complexity in there), you probably won't use it for code reuse [SEP] Agustina: unless this was just an except from a larger function to discuss this piece of the logic [SEP] Ashley: yeah, that's why I was thinking `**` could pretty much nullify the need for the function", "498": "Britt: Hi all, how could I best iterate through a list of regex's to format a string (when/if it get's to the correct corresponding pattern) and also raise an error if none of the regex patterns match [SEP] Britt: None [SEP] Clemmie: <@Britt>", "499": "Sasha: Let's consider the string `\"A\\nB\"`. In memory, this is three bytes: `0x41, 0x0A, 0x42`, or `A`, `linefeed`, `B`. But it would be awkward to have to hit return in the middle of typing it, so Python allows you to type `\\n` in your source code instead in order to get that linefeed character. And if you ask for the `repr()` of that string variable, it will back-convert the `0x0A` byte to `\"\\n\"` in printing it out. If you just `print()` the string, though, it'll give you a real linefeed and put the `B` on the following line. [SEP] Sasha: Since Python has those escaping rules involving the backslash, if you want an actual backslash character in your string, you would ordinarily use `\"\\\\\"` in your code, which is just one character in memory, and prints out as just `\\`. Though again, if you ask for the `repr()` form of the string, Python will back-convert to `\"\\\\\"` since `repr()` is supposed to be the source-code form of the string, basically. So if you want a literal `\\*`, two characters, you should have `\"\\\\*\"` in your source code. [SEP] Sasha: What you have now works only because there is no defined `\\*` escape sequence, so Python just says, \"Oh, he probably just meant a literal backslash in this case.\" However, when it gives you back the `repr()` form, it gives you the more proper source-code format, `\"\\\\*\"`.

As the name implies, the MainMenu class creates a menu with options like _Create Content_, _Update Content_, _Delete Content_ which load the `content/crud.py` which handles loading the appropriate file; ie `content/create.py`. In the create file there is an option to `Cancel` from which I try to load the `MainMenu` again. However, the _import_ gives me a circular import error. I understand why it happens, I am just unclear on how to _reuse_ previously imported classes. I have found quite a bit of suggestions online, but they are all fairly opaque and they all seem to have sentences like \"Well, you could do this, but...\" [SEP] Sasha: Sorry for the crickets, but as you note it's not a trivial problem. My best suggestion would be if there's some way you could pass in a reference to the `MainMenu` into the `Cancel` function, so it doesn't have to know that it's returning to a `MainMenu` specifically, but just returning to whatever menu object it was originally called from.

[SEP] Carrie: :confused: [SEP] Hiroko: and why python?  isn\u2019t there already something inside magento or php for this? [SEP] Waldo: Issue is we want to pull reports from different tables (which have pretty decent API endpoints themselves) to combine order information, refunds, invoices and any copoun codes used. There is no real single API endpoint that combines all that information [SEP] Hiroko: gotcha.  and you want to use python with this? [SEP] Hiroko: ok, I\u2019ve done something similar, but had to use a async task job to do that, because report generation took about 5 minutes total with about 4:50 of that building the excel file [SEP] Waldo: I do get crashes if the date range is too long and that is where threading may have to come in to play to split the data range i.e. if over 3 months split in to one month per request and thread the requests [SEP] Hiroko: anyway, the simplest way you could do it is with a cronjob and python script", "530": "Miguel: Hello, i have some trouble with slice.

[SEP] Waldo: There is some reporting within Magento, absolutely [SEP] Hiroko: what output format? [SEP] Waldo: Ideally as the scripts are then being run via cronjobs [SEP] Waldo: Effectively it takes the data, converts to JSON, does a load of logic across the report to create dictionaries with all relevant information and then converts those to a dataframe for further analysis &amp; formatting. The end output is then an excel workbook with multiple tabs [SEP] Hiroko: really?  :disappointed:  I didn\u2019t have to worry about that [SEP] Hiroko: the report would execute over a specific interval, say once a day at midnight [SEP] Waldo: So I have already got multiple reports running at their required time intervals however we are re-working how we recognise revenue therefore instead of looking at order tabel look at invoice table and credit table and get the Net for a given day [SEP] Waldo: To add more confusion in the mix the timestamps on the database are UTC, the server is set to UTC and we report on PST timezone (-8 hours) [SEP] Hiroko: oh boy [SEP] Hiroko: how much python experience do you have? [SEP] Waldo: mmm [SEP] Waldo: Couple of years on and off of tinkering and automating tasks [SEP] Waldo: Pretty solid understanding of core concepts [SEP] Hiroko: alright.  that makes things a little easier [SEP] Hiroko: so, xslxwriter is a great package for writing excel files [SEP] Waldo: oh sorry - my question was not so much about the how [SEP] Waldo: more about some of the why with report discrepancies [SEP] Waldo: Pandas can handle the excel writing easily with the ExcelWriter [SEP] Waldo: Everything is 'working' however when I do a daily breakdown for Jan there is one day that is showing c. 35% less revenue than what Magento is reporting [SEP] Waldo: I guess this is more focusing on nuances of Magento data structure [SEP] Waldo: Bu the above context also explains the moving parts [SEP] Hiroko: makes sense [SEP] Hiroko: but the why can be linked tightly with the how [SEP] Waldo: Yeah, appreciate that [SEP] Waldo: I think since sounding it out a little it is a case of printing out line by line what the script is doing and debugging where possible [SEP] Waldo: My assumption was there may have been an error with the data it was using to run the analysis (i.e. missing invoices) but they have all been confirmed to be correct [SEP] Waldo: so line by line it is and if there is anything more specific I will shout again!

[SEP] Waldo: nope - startup business right now [SEP] Hiroko: I used to work as the sole dev in a silo on a django project, and it did feel isolating at times, which is why I had to expand online connections [SEP] Waldo: My job is actually operations and a lot of this is automating management reporting so we can focus on decisions not collating data [SEP] Hiroko: makes sense [SEP] Waldo: hence why I find this group to be an amazing shoulder to cry on! [SEP] Hiroko: would integrating something like new relic or datadog be helpful? [SEP] Vanita: my teammate is 99% JS which is heart breaking... \"But it can do that.. no! It can't, not easily\" (recent convo around `return ...` before finishing a function in flask, it just can't happen [SEP] Waldo: I had the joys of working with a front end guy at a hackathon that clearly was not comfortable with nth child selection in CSS so ended up pretty much writing the whole view logic in the function [SEP] Hiroko: bet you\u2019re glad you won\u2019t have to worry about maintaining that :smile: [SEP] Waldo: I learnt quickly at hackathons no one cares as long as it lasts the demo [SEP] Hiroko: it was originally spawned from a FB hackathon, and stayed pretty much an operational hack throughout all of v15.  16 brought alot of perf improvements in that regard [SEP] Conrad: &gt;I used to work as the sole dev in a silo on a django project, and it did feel isolating at times, which is why I had to expand online connections\nI'm the sole dev right now on a django-backed web product, and it feels isolating, so that's why I've entered this group [SEP] Waldo: Also found my issue - dummy here was not multiplying item cost by qty ordered as assumed each item was a separate entry in an item list for the invoice! [SEP] Conrad: we have hired a dev and he joins month-end, but I wasn't too keen on that guy. the guy we wanted refused the offer at the last stage [SEP] Waldo: Let's hope he is not on this group! [SEP] Hiroko: <@Conrad> oh boy.  fun times.  that\u2019s why I came here, because everyone else in the shop was C#/Sitecore/angular, and I was python/django/react [SEP] Hiroko: so not too much overlap [SEP] Conrad: hahaha well he might be, and it might hurt to read this, but he knows his capability is not the best it could be, which is what I promised to him would increase a lot if he works here in the interview [SEP] Hiroko: <@Waldo> good job, not bad for early Monday :smile: [SEP] Hiroko: well, late for you :slightly_smiling_face:  I\u2019m just starting the day [SEP] Vanita: I'm just happy to have folks in EU time that are into Python [SEP] Conrad: <@Hiroko> C# is nice. I started out in C# in college and it was my first irc channel [SEP] Hiroko: agreed, I started out in java, so lots of similarities [SEP] Hiroko: but not too much when you\u2019re quite literally 8 years out of date and having to pay for extended support [SEP] Hiroko: which was the case with the other team\u2019s sitecore platform [SEP] Vanita: there\u2019s no Ireland flag? doh :disappointed: [SEP] Vanita: :flag-ie: [SEP] Vanita: ah [SEP] Waldo: there it is [SEP] Conrad: 8 years [SEP] Vanita: i spent a fair chunk of my twenties hanging out with a guy called Dave Edwards strangely [SEP] Conrad: ouch [SEP] Waldo: Was he overly dependent on beer in his 20s? [SEP] Vanita: half head Dave. He shaved one side of his head and alternated long sleeve on one side, short on the other and long trousers on one side, shorts on the other [SEP] Vanita: rode a unicycle everywhere [SEP] Waldo: haha ok definitely not me!!

I\u2019ll make a note of that. [SEP] Ashley: <@Javier> do you have an `__init__.py` file in `Z:/useful_functions/`? [SEP] Hiroko: show your file structure, <@Javier> [SEP] Carmen: Rendering HTML takes a decent bit of effort, but if you don't *have* to render HTML, if you just need to plug in values and the rest of the formatting can come from the ODT template document, that might be easier. [SEP] Javier: <@Hiroko> I did? [SEP] Kristine: Yeah, as long as the ODT template can have images in it (which from the time I\u2019ve spent in Open/Libre Office I\u2019m sure it can) then that\u2019s a great solution. [SEP] Ashley: <@Javier> they mean a screenshot of all the files and folders inside `Z:/useful_functions/` [SEP] Carmen: Is the image dynamic, or will it be static? [SEP] Ashley: I think they mean* [SEP] Javier: <@Ashley> I do it has `name = \"useful_functions\"` in it [SEP] Hiroko: if you dont have an `__init__.py`, that directory is not a package [SEP] Hiroko: directory/folder != package [SEP] Javier: I do have __init__.py [SEP] Kristine: Static image, it\u2019s going to be a couple of things like company logos.

[SEP] Javier: I'm just trying to import in a python terminal in vs code. [SEP] Ashley: ah ok [SEP] Ashley: yeah, so basically, the python interpreter you're running has no idea where that package is [SEP] Javier: I tried telling it that it was in Z [SEP] Ashley: IIRC, it looks in the site-packages folder associated with that python binary, or in the current working directory [SEP] Javier: Yeah, do I need to add to sys.path before I run? [SEP] Ashley: I would just wrap it all in another folder, and then put a setup.py in the parent folder so you can treat it like an installable repo [SEP] Tabetha: You can edit sys.path, but it would be better to give that hint as you run the application using the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`. Or ever better, install it locally [SEP] Ashley: you can look up a super simple setuptools setup.py example to copy and paste, and then just run `python setup.py develop` from that directory [SEP] Javier: I don't know what any of that is [SEP] Ashley: that'l tell that python executable where to look for the files (`python setup.py install` will build a copy to put into your site-packages folder, so it won't see the changes you make. `develop` just points to the original files so it sees the changes you make) [SEP] Ashley: <@Javier> no worries [SEP] Ashley: so to recap real quick [SEP] Ashley: you can have multiple python executables on a single machine. this is what makes virtual environments feasible [SEP] Ashley: every python executable has a location hard-coded into it that points to a specific `site-packages` folder [SEP] Ashley: the `site-packages` folder is where a python executable will look to find all the packages that it has \"installed\" [SEP] Ashley: this is what \"installing a package\" means in the context of python [SEP] Ashley: `setuptools` is a tool package meant to make developing installable python packages easier/consistent [SEP] Ashley: it does this through a `setup.py` file, which, typically, shouldn't be inside your python package itself. Instead, it usually sits in the folder just above it [SEP] Javier: Okay I think I understand now [SEP] Ashley: for example, here's the repo for pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/> [SEP] Ashley: you can see the `setup.py` file in the root, but the package code itself is actually in a deeper folder [SEP] Javier: My phone is dying I'll have to look at that later. [SEP] Ashley: typically, you'd see the first `__init__.py` somewhere like `&lt;root folder&gt;/src/__init__.py` [SEP] Ashley: no worries [SEP] Javier: <@Ashley> :taco:  [SEP] Ashley: check out setuptools and setup.py tutorials, and they will walk you through. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to get you up and running [SEP] Javier: I will do that [SEP] Javier: I've been struggling with absolute paths for a while. It's so simple and I have absolutely no idea why it isn't working [SEP] Ashley: yeah, you have the right idea [SEP] Ashley: it's just kinda annoying to tell python where to look [SEP] Ashley: unfortunately, you can't tell it where to look directly. instead you have to put files where it's already looking (i.e. `site-packages/`) that point at your code, and setuptools can take care of that for you [SEP] Micki: any body can help with threads and state machine", "561": "Kristine: Hey guys, I\u2019m going to be getting a letter in which I will have to input some information from an API and print regularly.

[SEP] Jonas: Find out where the trigger should be called and work back from there  [SEP] Jonas: Adding prints everywhere.

So I\u2019m not sure. Flask is very popular, so you\u2019ll probably have more tutorials available for it. [SEP] Deangelo: cool, I might perhaps also use a swagger code generator to build the api interface dynamically based on api specs [SEP] Carmen: Flask literally took me a single Python script and an HTML template to build a microservice. It's hard to get much simpler and faster than that. [SEP] Deangelo: good to know. by the way, I'm not looking to serve html, just a plain rest interface to do some calcs, call another service and return back numbers [SEP] Deangelo: which is why I don't need all the features of a web framework [SEP] Carmen: Then yeah, you could potentially implement the entire thing in a single Python file. [SEP] Hiroko: <@Deangelo> if you're interested in having async, you can make your own pretty easily with aiohttp or quart  [SEP] Hiroko: Quart is basically flask on asyncio  [SEP] Deangelo: thanks <@Hiroko> I'm currently looking at integrating a swagger generator and either flask or falcon using the generated client to implement the api endpoints [SEP] Hiroko: reason I pointed out async is you described your desires as\n\n&gt;just a plain rest interface to do some calcs, call another service and return back numbers [SEP] Hiroko: which, to me, means lots of blocking actions [SEP] Hiroko: if you\u2019re able to do them concurrently, means better workload overall and more efficiency [SEP] Deangelo: that's a good point. I'm surprised python can do async. does it implement an event loop to achieve this? [SEP] Hiroko: yes [SEP] Hiroko: but unlike node, python has multithreading and multiprocessing [SEP] Hiroko: so you can kick off the compute intensive futures to threads and processes to execute [SEP] Hiroko: whereas with node, you\u2019re all single threaded in the event loop, which means if you\u2019re doing compute with IO returns, that\u2019s clogging up the event loop [SEP] Jonas: Threading can be a bit tricky though, as technically python itself is single threaded  [SEP] Hiroko: correct.  but you can also set it up so one asyncio event loop exists per thread [SEP] Hiroko: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52298922/how-do-i-set-the-asyncio-event-loop-for-a-thread-in-python/52301233#52301233> [SEP] Jonas: So you need to be somewhat careful about what you offload to a thread, if it calls a C function that doesn't release the GIL then bad things can happen [SEP] Hiroko: :point_up: [SEP] Hiroko: as always, there\u2019s no silver bullet.  there\u2019s always caveats and edge cases [SEP] Deangelo: so this looks like something you can easily introduce to an existing flask application, or does it have to be setup when creating the project? [SEP] Hiroko: check out <https://github.com/pgjones/quart> [SEP] Deangelo: I was just looking there [SEP] Jonas: it's not usually something you can just plug into an existing app [SEP] Jonas: you'd need to make big changes to how it works. For example, you can't do `requests.get()` in the service [SEP] Jonas: if you're interacting with a database, that needs to be changed [SEP] Jonas: it's well worth it though. 90+% of the time spent in a flask app is just networking stuff: redis, the database, receiving/reading the response [SEP] Deangelo: &gt; It should be possible to migrate to Quart from Flask by a find and replace of flask to quart and then adding async and await keywords.

[SEP] Karoline: so even if you don't call sys.exit at all, when run via vscode it shows this exception being thrown? [SEP] Shawana: as you mentioned the try: except Exception handling is bad practice.. that makes me ponder on how to do better :mhhhm\n\n\nno [SEP] Karoline: I mean - it's not the end of the world.

So my thoughts were I could use python, maybe make use of selenium. But will it be able to handle all scenarios? For example. I need to open a windows application login into and perform some tasks that the program does. The program itself is built with Java selectors. Is selenium the best tool for this? Or can/should I use another package [SEP] Karoline: Selenium handles web stuff - is this a native app or on the web? [SEP] Shawana: ahh, found something\napp.exec_() is required for running the QT-App and returning the exit_code when closed, so far expected\nwhen calling sys.exit on it, it should close without exception as expected too.. but vscode debugger also tracks \"uncaught exceptions\", that's where the debugger throws it out [SEP] Arturo: native [SEP] Arturo: but eventually will be on the web [SEP] Arturo: but for now native [SEP] Karoline: yeah selenium won't help there [SEP] Arturo: ah ok [SEP] Arturo: found something that might be useful, <http://pywinauto.github.io/> [SEP] Arturo: can anyone comment on it?", "659": "Kera: Hello [SEP] Kera: I want to add the reset function on QSpectrumAnalyzer...

[SEP] Carmen: Are you sending the `f1` input into `f2`, or just calling `f2` as part of processing the input for `f1`, and its parameters are completely separate? [SEP] Angele: The latter [SEP] Carmen: Do you have a complete list of the inputs you're applying the function to, or is it something that happens inside the MoviePy library code, and thus you can only provide a lambda that they're invoking? [SEP] Angele: I have a complete list of the inputs (all frames in the video clip) in advance. But based on each frame's processing in f2 (my own user defined function) I want to modify the input to the subsequent call to f2 (which processes the next frame) [SEP] Carmen: That's good. I'd recommend you write a third function `f3` that takes the function `f2` and your frame list as parameters, then loops through the inputs, applying `f1` and storing the output of `f1` (which should include whatever `f2` is returning) for providing to the next loop. [SEP] Carmen: In rough form:\n```def f3(f2, frame_list):\n    f2_param = None\n    return_list = []\n    for frame in frame_list:\n        (other_output, f2_param) = f1(f2, frame, f2_param)\n       return_list.append(other_output)\n    return return_list\n``` [SEP] Angele: Hmm....ok let me give it a shot!

[SEP] Carmen: <@Angele> Can you provide a link to the documentation for whatever `f1` and `f2` are, so I can see their signatures? We're bumping into the limits of what I can help with without more information. I assumed you had more control over the function signatures; since that's not the case, I need more information. [SEP] Angele: <@Carmen> Sure, here's the documentation for f1: <https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/ref/VideoClip/VideoClip.html?highlight=fl_image#moviepy.video.compositing.CompositeVideoClip.CompositeVideoClip.fl_image>", "668": "Ashley: I don't believe so", "669": "Marc: Guys, I'm trying to solve the Two Sum leetcode problem and wanted to know what you thought of my solution?

[SEP] Nola: Does that make sense? [SEP] Nola: Oh. im sorry after reading it again i see what you did [SEP] Carmen: <@Angele> So what you'll want to do is be constructing a function that uses `f2` on the fly in `f3`.\n```\ndef f3(f2, frame_list):\n    f2_param = None\n    return_list = []\n    for frame in frame_list:\n        new_f2 = lambda img: f2(img, f2_param)\n        (other_output, f2_param) = fl_image(new_f2, frame)\n       return_list.append(other_output)\n    return return_list\n``` [SEP] Carmen: I realize that's not precisely how the library gets used, but it's close enough that you should be able to modify it appropriately. [SEP] Marth: <@Nola> honestly, not really.  I say the following not really knowing your data, so I could be wrong....but my thinking is that you *might* not need the \"if\" portion of your loop.

It might not be a nice `x + y + something` equation to calculate these in an easy way. :taco: [SEP] Mica: ye, dict comp is just a fast way, if you want it to be more readable you can covert to a normal for loop [SEP] Mica: then you can do all sorts of calc without it being squeezed onto one line [SEP] Aracelis: how [SEP] Mica: <https://realpython.com/python-string-formatting/> [SEP] Malena: But still, the question is a bit problematic. [SEP] Lorinda: hello guys [SEP] Lorinda: None [SEP] Lorinda: Guys I need help with the above code. [SEP] Ashley: What's your question? [SEP] Lorinda: This is from QSpectrumAnalyzer [SEP] Lorinda: and I have connected HackRF [SEP] Lorinda: This is the process initiated for the start button to start scanning. There is also encoded the restart process of the hardware (hackrf) and that's what I am trying to implement. I have made all the necessary changes and I now have created the def process_reset(self) to initiate the code hackrf_spiflash -R that does the reset. [SEP] Lorinda: However I don't understand the above code block that does the start... in order to mirror the process and do the reset process. [SEP] Ashley: What don't you understand about it? [SEP] Lorinda: I would like someone to explain line by line what it does... for example what is this: \"-f\", \"{}.... [SEP] Lorinda: I am pretty beginner and the task is above my level [SEP] Lorinda: but it must be done. [SEP] Ashley: Well, I can't really go line by line, but the bulk of it seems to pretty much just be generating a command to call in the shell/command prompt, and then at the end it does so [SEP] Ashley: It looks like you're printing out towards the end, which should tell you what the exact command is that it's calling [SEP] Lorinda: thanks for the tip [SEP] Lorinda: any idea how i could implement the reset function? [SEP] Lorinda: is the above code a good representation of what i must do with reseT? [SEP] Ashley: I'm unfamiliar with those tools, but probably not. But it should tell you what the main command is, and you can look up the documentation for it where there should be something about resetting it, if that's something it supports [SEP] Lorinda: yep the command hackrf_spiflash -r [SEP] Lorinda: does the reset [SEP] Lorinda: but i don't yet know how should i start to implent it on the process_reset() [SEP] Ashley: Oh, sorry, I misunderstood [SEP] Ashley: Then yeah, you can mimic the code in that function [SEP] Lorinda: ok where can i find what this does for example: \"-f\", \"{}:{}\".format(int(self.params[\"start_freq\"] - self.lnb_lo / 1e6),\n                                     int(self.params[\"stop_freq\"] - self.lnb_lo / 1e6)), [SEP] Ashley: Well, the `\"{}:{}\u201d.format()` stuff is just how string formatting is done in Python (there's a few ways, but this is a common one) [SEP] Ashley: In general, Python has to evaluate things in a certain order [SEP] Ashley: You'll notice that that's inside a `cmdline.extend()` call. `cmdline` seems to be just a normal list, and the `extend` method of a list takes another list, and slaps it into the end of that list [SEP] Ashley: So you're \"extending\" `cmdline` [SEP] Ashley: But to know what you're extending it with, Python has to figure out what you're passing to `extend` [SEP] Ashley: And to figure the out, it has to evaluate the things inside of the list one at a time [SEP] Ashley: The first thing is easy. It's just `\"-f\"` [SEP] Ashley: But the next thing takes a little more, because to figure that out, it has to look at the things you're passing to `format` [SEP] Ashley: It's kinda like PEMDAS [SEP] Ashley: If you ignore the `subprocess` and `QtCore` stuff, you're pretty much only dealing with simple python stuff (it's really just lists, numbers, and strings). It's only the context that seems complicated, but you know what you're working with, so you should be fine [SEP] Lorinda: Thanks a lot for the help and time.

I have my main module (tkinter) which uses stored variables to be fired off within another module. i.e. enter date and date is used in the other module. the issue is that I am having to type out each function separate and i have a feeling this is not the right way, or at least the best way, to do this. Another issue is that in the line \"SSH_Invoices.c_date = self.page1_sel_date.get()\" - \"c_date\" does not get stored. [SEP] Jonas: What is `SSH_Invoices`? A module? [SEP] Nenita: correct. it is the main class name [SEP] Jonas: Wait, is it a module or a class? [SEP] Clemmie: Can you do an `__init__` that takes the date and a run flag, if you pass the run flag it triggers `statements()` [SEP] Nenita: class more specifically. module name is actually SSH. [SEP] Jonas: You might need to show some more code, there is for sure a better way [SEP] Jonas: but it's hard to tell with a few lines [SEP] Nenita: would that __init__ be in the SSH module or in my main module? [SEP] Nenita: alright one sec [SEP] Jonas: Ok, so a module in Python is a file. It's all the contents of a file bundled up into an object, a 'module' [SEP] Jonas: Generally you never do `module.something = something_else` [SEP] Jonas: unless you really, really know what you're doing. [SEP] Clemmie: It would be in `SSH_Invoices`, but at the moment you are not using instances, just `classmethod/static` calls [SEP] Jonas: Classes live in modules, and are created by doing `something = SomeClass()`. You can pass things into a class by calling it like a function: `SomeClass(some_variable, something=else)` [SEP] Jonas: You have `__init__` methods on classes, not modules. [SEP] Jonas: And when you do `SomeClass()` the `SomeClass.__init__` is called with it's arguments [SEP] Nenita: this is the ssh module. please notate that with been having to go back and forth trying to figure this out, I have had to make some changes that were not there originally. i.e. when I ran the module separately rather than using my main module. [SEP] Nenita: one sec and... [SEP] Nenita: this is the line that is calling all of  it. now this function is really messy. Haven't been working on it too long. [SEP] Nenita: oh! <@Jonas> i see what your saying [SEP] Mica: you need to instantiate the class [SEP] Jonas: Ok, so I see a few issues here [SEP] Mica: the only exception is for staticmethods :parrot: [SEP] Jonas: In general it's not great practice to do what you are doing in `.statements()` [SEP] Jonas: you're setting some variables, then you _expect_ people to call `run_statements()` [SEP] Jonas: which uses a class variable and does the right thing :tm: [SEP] Jonas: you could make `run_statements` accept an argument of statements [SEP] Jonas: then when you call `statements()`, it then calls `self.run_statements([....])`? [SEP] Nenita: thats what im planning [SEP] Nenita: after i read your previous comment [SEP] Jonas: :+1: avoid passing state around using instance variables. [SEP] Jonas: So, for your `statements()` method, it needs a date [SEP] Jonas: so why not add this as an argument [SEP] Jonas: then do `SSH_invoices.statements(self.page1_sel_date.get())`? [SEP] Nenita: yep, thats why i ask the question from the get-go because I was like, 'there is no way i am going to find a good answer as specific as im needing using google'. [SEP] Jonas: You also need an instance of the class, as <@Mica> pointed out. So try doing `invoices = SSH_Invoices()` [SEP] Jonas: then `invoices.statements()` [SEP] Nenita: i plan on doing that. after reading your comment \"You can pass things into a class by calling it like a function: `SomeClass(some_variable, something=else)`\" [SEP] Jonas: :+1: awesome. One other thing, you may want to keep the `SSH_Invoices` object around for a while [SEP] Nenita: aaaand now i see what you mean by an instance of a class. lol [SEP] Jonas: it creates a SSH client which may be expensive to create [SEP] Jonas: so you could do `invoices = SSH_Invoices()` at the top of your module, after your imports [SEP] Jonas: or somewhere else that runs when the app starts.

It appears to take your `f2` function as the first parameter and the image as the second parameter. The `new_f2` function is my way of converting the 2-parameter function into a 1-parameter function, which is what the `f1_image` function is expecting. [SEP] Angele: I see the problem now: new_f2 returns a tuple ( the image and the new parameter). However, fl_image needs to access only the image (first element of the tuple) [SEP] Angele: So, the question is; How can f1-image access the first element of the tuple returned by new_f2?

[SEP] Claudine: in my example you just loop over each url and call `socket.gethostbyname()` on each one and that function will return the IP address of that URL [SEP] Claudine: and then you just gotta put the domain and the IP together [SEP] Chiquita: you made a new dictionary by iterating through each domain and getting the info.. so if I look at domain_ips it will be all the info.

Something that's intuitive to use, aesthetically appealing and interactive? [SEP] Misha: None [SEP] Misha: i started getting error on the second line [SEP] Claudine: <@Aleshia> It might depend on what you are trying to visualize, personally I like matplot but <http://plot.ly|plot.ly> seems good, `best` might be subjective [SEP] Misha: None [SEP] Misha: Pls what am i missing? [SEP] Aleshia: Well Matplotlib looks little old to me and was wondering if some of the newer packages would make better plots more easily. Like, In R ggplot is clear winner.  [SEP] Claudine: is `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()` a float? [SEP] Aleshia: The syntax of plotly looked complicated to me , though the graphs look great. [SEP] Claudine: python has a ggplot module :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Misha: is not [SEP] Misha: it's int [SEP] Misha: but don't know how to go about it [SEP] Aleshia: Yeah, didn't see it getting used very often though...not sure why [SEP] Claudine: looks like your error says it needs a float, you may just be able to cast it to one [SEP] Cherish: <@Aleshia> I\u2019d second matplotlib. The learning curve can be tough depending on what type of visualizations you\u2019re making. The examples/docs you\u2019ll find will sometimes be OO version and sometimes not which can be annoying. I\u2019ve used it quite a bit for a couple years now though and the level of control you have over it is awesome. Happy to answer any specific questions you might have [SEP] Claudine: `float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean())` [SEP] Misha: ok [SEP] Misha: let me give it a try [SEP] Claudine: yea I made my own wrapper class for matplotlib that automates the setup &amp; colors and stuff [SEP] Claudine: now it's super fast to make charts [SEP] Claudine: just a simple `line(x,y)` or `bar(x,y` and im good to go [SEP] Claudine: i cant say i've done more complicated visualization though [SEP] Claudine: geomapping would be my next trick, one day [SEP] Cherish: I\u2019m doing that right now actually. Which leads to a question of my own: is there a good resource explaining how to get such a module onto PyPi so other people within my company can grab it with pip? I want to make sure for some standardized data visualizations the output is the same regardless of who generates the plots [SEP] Claudine: i see matplotlib referenced the most so I assume it's sort of a defacto standard [SEP] Misha: <@Claudine> I got this error `TypeError: float() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)` [SEP] Jorge: i dont have a lof of experience with them, but seaborn and bokeh are things to check out [SEP] Claudine: huh, what's `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()` do if you print 'er on out? [SEP] Misha: I want to calculate *the mean* loan amount in 30-day loans and what is *the standard deviation* of loan amount in 90-day loans? and my answers to the nearest two decimal places. [SEP] Claudine: i was just looking at seaborn and it looks cool, built on top of matplotlib but with modern aesthetics [SEP] Claudine: sorry poor wording, i meant what is output of printing `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()` [SEP] Claudine: if `float()` thinks `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()` has two values [SEP] Misha: None [SEP] Claudine: oh yea i see, i may have lead you astray, `round(float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean(), 2)).iloc[1,1]` maybe [SEP] Claudine: well [SEP] Claudine: no [SEP] Claudine: `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()` is that whole table, if you want to round one of the values you have to call `round` on a single value [SEP] Claudine: if `.iloc[1,1]` is intended to grab that one value you'll have to move that inside your `round()` call [SEP] Misha: Ok [SEP] Claudine: `round(float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean().iloc[1,1]), 2)` maybe [SEP] Misha: Ok [SEP] Cherish: Oh, also touching on your point about interactive plots <@Aleshia> -- I recently found the `mpld3` library. This is super convenient for sharing visualizations (2D support only) that are still interactive. You can save a `matplotlib` `Figure` to an HTML file using `mpld3.save_html(figure, 'filename.html')`, that others can then open up and interact with the data in the same way they would if they generated the figure themselves: [SEP] Claudine: oh by the way it'd probably be best to keep this in one channel, i see we're splitting this across here and <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> . No need to repeat question in multiple channels [SEP] Misha: Ok <@Claudine>....Thanks it worked... YIPPEE [SEP] Claudine: nice [SEP] Claudine: hit me with a taco :pacman: [SEP] Misha: <@Claudine> :pacman: [SEP] Cherish: :taco: <@Claudine> like this <@Misha> [SEP] Misha: lol [SEP] Claudine: ha thanks [SEP] Claudine: yea just @ my name and then add a taco emoji [SEP] Claudine: i do it all for the taco [SEP] Misha: :pacman:<@Claudine> [SEP] Misha: novice me :disappointed: [SEP] Claudine: lol no no :taco:  not :pacman: [SEP] Claudine: dont worry haha [SEP] Claudine: it's just internet points for fun [SEP] Ashley: <@Claudine> :taco: [SEP] Ashley: or you can also react with :taco:  on the person's message [SEP] Ashley: welp, nevermind on the reacting bit. could have sworn I read that somewhere haha [SEP] Misha: <@Claudine> :taco: [SEP] Ashley: <@Misha> we give tacos as rewards for help or general awesomeness, and those who receive them consume them with :pacman: (usually as a reaction on the message that gave the taco). And you have 5 tacos to give out every day [SEP] Ashley: exactly [SEP] Misha: Pls how do i go about the *the standard deviation* of loan amount in 90-day loans? and my answers to the nearest two decimal places. [SEP] Ashley: that is more of a statistics question, than a python one. I would hit up khan academy. they probably have some good video tutorials on how to calculate that [SEP] Misha: Thanks <@Ashley> [SEP] Ashley: :+1: [SEP] Misha: pls i still need to solve this [SEP] Hiroko: is this a homework question?

Here, I'm using a library to create an aws `cloudformation` stack.  I want to replace the `eks_cluster_name` for the `ClusterName`.  Apparently, I can't because the data types are different. [SEP] Claudine: no problem, you could also check out the python module `numpy` which had built in methods for calulcating standard deviation along a specific axis [SEP] Claudine: it's been awhile since i've done any statistical work so I'm not sure myself off the top of my head [SEP] Claudine: `numpy` might be a little unwiedly if you're new to python, it was for me when i started [SEP] Claudine: <@Carlota> do you know the expected data type and what the data type of `eks_cluster_name` are? [SEP] Misha: `round(float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').std().iloc[4,1]), 2)` [SEP] Misha: I tried this and it worked [SEP] Carlota: <@Claudine> the data type for the ```    eks_cluster_name = ImportValue(Sub('${VPCStackName}::EKSClusterName'))\n```\nthe response is a string while it is substituting some of the parameters.  For example, the `${BootstrapArguments}` will be replaced with the parameters passed in the stack. [SEP] Hiroko: <@Misha> when it comes to homework questions, you\u2019ll get much better responses when you show what you\u2019ve done and ask a question, or describe your current understanding and what you\u2019re unsure about [SEP] Hiroko: rather than asking \u201chow do I solve this problem\u201d [SEP] Hiroko: it may very well be a language barrier, and you didn\u2019t mean it that way.  but that is a little how you did come across. [SEP] Claudine: <@Carlota> oh i was curious if `print(type(eks_cluster_name)` was `str` [SEP] Hiroko: and if my interpretation is incorrect, then I apologize [SEP] Misha: I think 1 is for row  and 4 for  column [SEP] Misha: yes <@Hiroko> [SEP] Misha: I'm a working professional (12yrs in media production) and running a small tech startup [SEP] Misha: And I just think it will be of good benefit to dive into Data Science and I just started 3wks ago [SEP] Misha: And I pick up a lesson note online by myself to start solving [SEP] Misha: now i'm encoutering some prob and i need human being to explain something to me...lol:grinning: [SEP] Misha: Nevertheless thanks for the advise <@Hiroko> [SEP] Cherish: <@Marc> that'll happen on your last iteration because `s[ind]` will be grabbing your last value, so `s[ind + 1]` will be out of range.

[SEP] Waldo: so a list of lists as the date key value? [SEP] Mica: I'd remove Sales into a separate DF [SEP] Mica: so you'd have a dict of date:sales_df [SEP] Waldo: slightly confused... how would that look?

It can integrate with your existing workflow to enable continuous code inspection across your project branches and pull requests (code here is done using pyspark and sparksql) [SEP] Mica: code smells you could use something like mypy, black. pep8, isort. etc [SEP] Mica: as for detecting bugs, you could always run tests in the CI? [SEP] Hiroko: automatic?  no [SEP] Hiroko: run tests in CI, use linting tools to enforce agreed upon convention [SEP] Hiroko: but actual code review?  how would that work? [SEP] Jonas: I'd say you haven't installed it correctly then :smile: [SEP] Hiroko: how would you determine a less than optimimal approach or a possible better structure?  suggesting documentation? [SEP] Jonas: If you paste the command you're running to install it and the output we can give you a hand [SEP] Hiroko: if you want code analysis, there\u2019s sonarqube [SEP] Hiroko: <https://www.sonarqube.org/> [SEP] Hiroko: but not sure how well it would work for dynamic languages like python.  I know it works best with static types like java/c#/etc [SEP] Karoline: I usually run black, pyflakes, and mypy and then there is manual review [SEP] Ji: I am using Sonarqube in golang. But i have not used in pyspark.\nFor python also there is a plugin. I have not tested it [SEP] Hiroko: true, but there\u2019s always going to be limitations because of the dynamic nature of the language, particularly if you\u2019re not using typings or mypy [SEP] Hiroko: are you using manual code review in addition to this? [SEP] Ji: Yes i am doing a manual code review. But sometimes when you write the code you might end up with cognitive complexity. [SEP] Ji: so i want to highlight such things for later refactor [SEP] Karoline: I don't know how much a tool can really help with that.  I mean there's things like mccabe complexity checking - but especially if it's simply advisory and going to be dealt with later I dunno how much having that as an automatic part of a PR would help [SEP] Ji: when i said i would later refactor. it is not left like that. I would address this as soon as possible. you are right using the tool seems useless [SEP] Karoline: If I'm using an automated tool in my PRs it's usually to give me a yes/no answer. [SEP] Karoline: especially just because they avoid argument.  the worst thing is getting people disagreeing about how important something is and a PR dragging on about what should/shouldn't be fixed. [SEP] Ji: Yes you can use it against every PR but then it becomes an overhead (All PR is done by manual reivew, which is enough).\nI would rather keep it simple get the things running and then refactor code based on complexity and performance.\nThe main usecase for me is to highlight writing a shitty code gives us pain in the end and force people to create better quality (i believe people learn faster when they see something :slightly_smiling_face: ). [SEP] Hiroko: is that shitty code fairly visible in review or when working on tickets? [SEP] Hiroko: eg, when you\u2019re working on a ticket and you come across X thing that could be done better.  why not file a ticket for that, especially if you have a tech debt epic/bucket [SEP] Hiroko: and then you can allocate 10-20% of your team\u2019s weekly work to cleaning up those kind of tickets [SEP] Ji: I do agree with you <@Hiroko> that is the best approach. But sometime some slip through. [SEP] Karoline: that's going to happen [SEP] Ji: So such tooling which just give me overview helps me catch those [SEP] Hiroko: and are you sure you\u2019re going to get a higher signal to noise ratio with thoe tools? [SEP] Ji: I believe SonarQube does that [SEP] Karoline: I'd say throw the linters and mccabe at it, and use those to gate new PRs.  And anything beyond that is realistically going to have to come from the culture of your dev team [SEP] Hiroko: and project managers too [SEP] Ji: i just want to help dev team :wink: . Project managers are whole different species :smile: [SEP] Hiroko: PMs really should help the dev team and be the interface between devs and stakeholders [SEP] Karoline: I mean they list their \"code smells\" - <https://rules.sonarsource.com/python/type/Code%20Smell/RSPEC-124> [SEP] Hiroko: if theyre not doing that, there\u2019s a bigger problem [SEP] Karoline: I'm unimpressed with what it does beyond the normal linter, to be honest [SEP] Hiroko: files should not have too many lines of code? [SEP] Hiroko: doesn\u2019t really state what the limit is [SEP] Ji: Thanks guys i will try to keep it simple and do it with linters for start [SEP] Hiroko: cognitive complexity\u2026 would be interesting how that\u2019s determined [SEP] Karoline: use the linters and don't make them advisory.  fail PRs that linting [SEP] Karoline: <@Hiroko> my guess is they just run mccabe [SEP] Hiroko: <https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf> [SEP] Hiroko: looks to be built off mccabe [SEP] Karoline: a lot of this just seems to be built off of the existing linters really [SEP] Karoline: another thing I'll add, and I hope I'm not beating a dead horse here, but it's coming a up a lot as I get deeper into the new place I'm at so it's on my mind - anything automated to tell you things that isn't designed to require a response is destined to be ignored.  my prediction is if this is just an advisory thing on your PRs, people start out peeking at what it says, but will begin to ignore it as they realize it has no bearing on whether their work gets merged or not. [SEP] Karoline: worse - they may internalized its continued griping about their \"shitty code\" and get demoralized. [SEP] Karoline: so if you want to integrate tools like this into CI - make failing the tool fail CI [SEP] Ji: Yes you are right people will get demoralised if flagged every single time.\nIn go project which i worked with we used this check (like a  good to have), not to flag things as shitty code.\nLike you said before we sit as a team we take a look into code smell and remove it before moving it into production. I am taking that learning into the new project but this is in pyspark and spark sql. So i wanted to know if Sonarqube is the most recommended or just use the basic linter.\nI did realize dev team who is in this is not used to these toolings and code quality. So it is a thin line for making people frustrated. [SEP] Karoline: Yeah it can be especially tough working with data science stuff, the expectations for developers there are often different.

You'll have to work the problem backwards a little bit.

I\u2019m using it on the way to a SQL database and it\u2019s messing things up by using double quotes when it replaces. [SEP] Sasha: Can you clarify? The quotes around debug output aren't actually present in the string, if that's what you mean. [SEP] Devin: for example [SEP] Devin: None [SEP] Devin: and since this is being injected into a SQL statement it\u2019s mucking things up [SEP] Devin: i\u2019ve noticed that everything is single quotes except for instances where the replace was performed [SEP] Devin: and to get the SQL to work that would need to be\n`'Mary''s Pizza'` instead of `\"Mary''s Pizza\"` [SEP] Carmen: Please post a copy of the code doing the replacing. [SEP] Devin: `r[76].value.replace(\"'\", \"''\")` [SEP] Devin: i\u2019m having a hard time googling this one because it\u2019s tons of results where people want to replace double quotes lol [SEP] Carmen: And how are you adding it to the SQL? Because what you're doing in the replace shouldn't have anything to do with surrounding quotes. [SEP] Devin: well i\u2019m pulling the example (like in the screenshot) before it\u2019s passed [SEP] Carmen: In that case, we're going to need to see a full copy of the code. What you're describing should not be happening at all from a simple replace operation. [SEP] Devin: but it is\u2026 [SEP] Devin: lol [SEP] Devin: in python i know you can interchange `'` and `\"` for strings, but is there a way to perhaps force one? [SEP] Devin: because it seems that the `.replace` function is outputting `\"` [SEP] Carmen: Then show us the code. There is absolutely no way to reproduce what you're seeing without having the code to run. [SEP] Devin: sure - i was trying to save time. For context I\u2019m loading an excel file and pushing it to a database. [SEP] Devin: two parts: [SEP] Devin: None [SEP] Devin: And this is the function from that `Database` class [SEP] Devin: None [SEP] Devin: and I can\u2019t post a screenshot because it\u2019s sensitive info, but I can clearly see that the results of the `.replace` are in double quotes and everything else is in single quotes [SEP] Sasha: Are you looking at the print output, or what is ending up in the database? [SEP] Devin: print output because i haven\u2019t got it to push to the DB yet and the error is super vague [SEP] Devin: So i was entering the output of the query directly into MSSQL [SEP] Devin: and when i run it I get an error on those lines [SEP] Devin: yes - and those end up getting replaced [SEP] Hiroko: Escape them, then [SEP] Devin: that\u2019s not the problem, it\u2019s that their entire surrounding string turns from single quotes to double quotes [SEP] Devin: nothing in the string itself [SEP] Devin: i mean that might not be it but i\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what it is [SEP] Raguel: what is the error you are getting? [SEP] Hiroko: Quotes, whether single or double, don't matter to the db  [SEP] Devin: scratch all of that - a better question for me would be how can I output what is actually being passed to SQL [SEP] Devin: so say i\u2019m doing this `self.cur.execute(sql, values)` [SEP] Devin: how can i view the output of that? [SEP] Devin: other than this? `print(sql, values)` [SEP] Hiroko: What database  [SEP] Hiroko: And have you looked how to escape quotes in sql? [SEP] Devin: it\u2019s mssql - and yes it\u2019s escaped correctly for sql, but the double quotes surrounding that string is where i\u2019m running into an issue [SEP] Hiroko: How do you know that? [SEP] Hiroko: You haven't said anything about the specifics of the error [SEP] Devin: because i\u2019m running it in SQL and it\u2019s breaking [SEP] Devin: for example\n`INSERT INTO xyz (f1, f1, f3, f4) ('value 1', 'value two', \"value''s three\", 'value four')` [SEP] Devin: the double quotes are a no no for MSSQL [SEP] Raguel: if you are doing directly in db, MSSQL will throw an error \u2014 doing with Python shouldn\u2019t [SEP] Devin: ok - so back to my other question how do i see EXACTLY what it is passing? [SEP] Devin: because maybe it is fine, you\u2019re right [SEP] Carmen: Just as a test, I did a minimum-viable check on the replace itself and I'm not getting any surrounding quote issues whatsoever.

[SEP] Hiroko: well, method not allowed means HTTP method [SEP] Hiroko: so, that seems to be an issue of how your flask server is hitting that API [SEP] Hiroko: eg, if its expecting a POST when only a GET is mapped to that endpoint, you\u2019ll get a 405 [SEP] Kristine: Well the problem is that I\u2019m not sending anything to their server, it\u2019s the other way around. Their API sends POSTs to my server, and I\u2019m the one that gave them the 405 [SEP] Hiroko: ah, ok [SEP] Hiroko: so, is there a POST handler mapped to the URL? [SEP] Hiroko: and is the URL in the mapping correct? [SEP] Kristine: Yeah, I just tried changing it from args.get to form.get, waiting for the manager to come back to he can trigger another test from the system. [SEP] Hiroko: for example, if you map `/some-resource/&lt;uuid&gt;/` and try calling it without the trailing slash, unless its specifically set up to handle that, you can get a 404 or 405 [SEP] Kristine: Here\u2019s what it comes in as on flask\u2019s console `X.X.X.X - - [20/Feb/2019 15:31:36] \"POST /velocify? HTTP/1.1\" 200 -`\n\nAnd here\u2019s what I have at the moment (after the change I just mentioned:\n```@app.route('/velocify', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef form_example():\n    \n    if request.method == 'POST': \n        dateSold = request.form.get('date_sold')\n        firstName = request.form.get('first_name')\n        carrierName = request.form.get('carrier_name')\n        attendantName = request.form.get('attendant_name')``` [SEP] Kristine: Okay so the manager came back, and did a test one, and it went through this time with a 200, so I guess that was what I had to do, change from args to forms [SEP] Hiroko: that would make sense, if you\u2019re pushing form data [SEP] Kristine: Yeah, I thought it was just URL encoded, given the interface on their site where I configured the POST to my server, but apparently it\u2019s form data anyways. [SEP] Kristine: Hence the confusion. [SEP] Kristine: But thanks for the help.

Typically, people specify their package's dependencies in their `setup.py` file, which is a complex system you don't need to worry about at the moment.

First validate that the image is indeed blank, `im.show()` [SEP] Jonas: If so, check if it's the `region` you're taking a screenshot of [SEP] Jonas: Try just calling `pyautogui.screenshot()` and see if that works [SEP] Joette: you can replace the index [SEP] Joette: `df.index = some_new_index` [SEP] Joette: maybe `df.index = pd.Index(list(range(len(df.index))))` [SEP] Weldon: <@Jonas> Yes the image is blank.

[SEP] Clemmie: best bet is probably intercepting/injecting  json [SEP] Jonas: :point_up_2: if you're struggling to capture the screen just wait until you need to do object detection [SEP] Clemmie: <@Jonas> possibly not though.

[SEP] Weldon: Thanks guys. I will try again with json and xpath. [SEP] Clemmie: <@Keena> In python 3 a lambda doesn\u2019t take multiple params. You need to access the params as a list, so `return sorted(dict_of_word_count.iteritems(), key=lambda v_k: (v_k[1],v_k[0]), reverse=True)[0:20]` should work I think (found at <http://cheng.logdown.com/posts/2016/11/30/python3-lambda-parameter>) [SEP] Keena: <@Clemmie> thanks for quick reply. will look into it. is this good? --&gt; return sorted(dict_of_word_count.iteritems(), key=lambda k_v: v_k[1], reverse=True)[0:20] [SEP] Clemmie: if you want to sort on the values that should work I think, yes [SEP] Clemmie: but you switch the name `v_k` and `k_v` - jsut keep that variable name consistent [SEP] Clemmie: `k_v` is more correct [SEP] Keena: actually I got that code snippet on web as lambda(v, k): (k, v), reverse=True [SEP] Keena: so I thought about doing that thing [SEP] Keena: what do you say? [SEP] Clemmie: Right, but now you are naming one variable, not multiples. Before you named them so you could sort on them in reverse (v,k -&gt; k,v), now it is just one and you are using the list index to pick them out [SEP] Clemmie: `iteritems()` gives a them as `(key, value)` so `k_v` is most internally consistent [SEP] Carmen: <@Marth> Are your friends technical? Are you expecting them to run the script? Visit a webpage? The exactly workflow you want your friends to follow to get the data will help dictate what tools make the most sense. [SEP] Keena: got your point. trying out the thing which you explained.thank you buddy. [SEP] Clemmie: :thumbsup: [SEP] Marth: <@Carmen> They're gamers....so while certainly computer savvy, not \"technical\"  in the sense that I'm not expecting them to edit the script.  I'm expecting them to run the script which will provide an interface. That interface is going to list their twitch clips and allow them to sort/filter and then download those clips.  Currently, (as I'm told) filtering and sorting their clips is really bad....and then Twitch DOES allow them to download their clips, but it takes 3+ clicks per clip.  So I'm trying to help automate that process.  I'm not sure if a local .exe with gui or a webpage makes more sense. [SEP] Jimmy: Well it depends if you are familiar with any of the two [SEP] Carmen: I think you could honestly use either for that. If you've got webdev experience, doing it as a webapp might be easier than learning GUI programming, but if you'd have to learn either, I'd probably argue this particular app makes more sense as a local exe with GUI. [SEP] Marth: awesome.  Thanks!  That's helpful! <@Carmen> :taco: [SEP] Carmen: <https://www.pyinstaller.org/> is also an option, if you want to keep it mostly-Python [SEP] Sasha: Note that `for i in word` iterates over the characters in the string, not their index position. [SEP] Hiroko: `enumerate` is a generator that for each iteration, returns a tuple of index, value [SEP] Hiroko: `i` is the index of the location currently being looked at [SEP] Hiroko: `c` is the variable name for the value at that index location [SEP] Carmen: <@Marth> Electron is based on Node.js and Chromium.

Or is that outside of python itself? [SEP] Jonas: also the error you have given us is not the one you are experiencing, you are not doing string formatting [SEP] Leopoldo: <@Jonas> thank you. I\u2019ll play with that and try to understand. What does the c in enumerate(word) do? [SEP] Leopoldo: <@Sasha> ok so I wouldn\u2019t need to create an array if it\u2019s going to iterate over each character in a string? [SEP] Clemmie: <@Leopoldo> a string is already a list of characters [SEP] Leopoldo: <@Hiroko> Thank you for explaining that [SEP] Sasha: Well, I was more explaining why `i % 2` was giving you that error. In your code, `i` is a character, not a number. [SEP] Leopoldo: <@Clemmie> ok thanks [SEP] Leopoldo: Ok that makes sense, thank you <@Sasha> [SEP] Leopoldo: If I wanted to use i % 2, then I could combine that with say len(word) [SEP] Leopoldo: And define i = 0 [SEP] Sasha: Yes, you could do `for i in range(len(word))`. No need for the `i = 0`, since the `for` loop initializes it anyway. But I'd suggest you think about `enumerate` more... it's a nice elegant solution to have access to both the character and its position in your loop. [SEP] Leopoldo: Thank you for that for that @ <@Sasha>. I will do some more research. [SEP] Leopoldo: I don\u2019t understand how to implement your suggestion. I\u2019ve tried a couple of different ways but am failing so far. <@Jonas> [SEP] Clemmie: <@Leopoldo> you are mixing a few different concepts that each could do it themselves and getting twisted up.

[SEP] Clemmie: That way <@Candra> and I showed uses a list comprehension in the `join` call. List comprehensions are basically for loops for free, when you want the result to be a list [SEP] Clemmie: `str.join()` takes a list of strings and joins them into one string, with the str you called join on in between [SEP] Clemmie: so `','.join(['1','2','3'])` would result in `\"1,2,3\"` [SEP] Hiroko: and you did this by initiating an empty string with `''` [SEP] Hiroko: which made the `join` method available, because that\u2019s part of the string type", "904": "Demetrice: I'm writing a function that takes in an input from the user and inputs that into a string.

I thought it would only print out you if the user inputs a blank [SEP] Clemmie: This passes the `name` that the user input to the method `two_fer` [SEP] Clemmie: No, because you were calling the method without a parameter, which will then used the default parameter in the method signature(`def two_fer(name='you'):`) [SEP] Demetrice: I see what you're saying [SEP] Demetrice: Because i left it blank on the print statement in the bottom it would always default to the you that i put in the def statement [SEP] Demetrice: I getya i getya. Thank you [SEP] Demetrice: What else did i do wrong? [SEP] Clemmie: You handled the blank case in your `if` logic, and the default is handling the `None` case if no parameter (or `None`) is passed to the method [SEP] Clemmie: otherwise it is fine [SEP] Ashley: you can also do `if not name`, because `\"\"` is falsey [SEP] Demetrice: Gezz. Such a simple assignment. Hard to believe i was doing so much wrong. Thank you so much for the help [SEP] Clemmie: If you only wanted to mutate the `name` if name is blank for the `two_fer` method you could do the check for `''` inside the method [SEP] Clemmie: <@Ashley> is correct, but be aware that a lot of things are falsey, including `0` and `False`, also the time midnight and empty iterators. Take that into account if you are using falsey checking [SEP] Demetrice: Okay.

And while it works when i run the module it's failing a lot of the test conditions and i can't identify why [SEP] Demetrice: Here It is [SEP] Demetrice: def is_pangram(sentence):\n    alphabet = ''\n    alph = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    sentence = input(\"What is the string we would like to test?\")\n    for i in sentence:\n        if i in alph:\n            alphabet += i\n        else:\n            pass\n    alphabet = alphabet.lower()\n    if \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\" in alphabet:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\nprint(is_pangram(sentence = '')) [SEP] Demetrice: So i'm not sure if it's similar to earlier. I tried just calling sentence as is, in my print statement. and then i tried to just use a default argument instead in the def statement but that also didn't work [SEP] Demetrice: Update -- I defined sentence outside of the function and that helped out. But i'm still failing 4/10 cases [SEP] Leana: Please use the snippet feature, or backticks, when sharing code.

[SEP] Demetrice: Very cool. Thank You [SEP] Sasha: You seem to be expecting that the `alphabet` string will remove duplicates and sort itself automatically, or else you're misunderstanding how `in` works. [SEP] Demetrice: Good point. I know how to fix the duplicates [SEP] Demetrice: I thought by using \"in\" the order wouldn't matter [SEP] Demetrice: Do i need to make a list of each alphabet character? That would work, right? [SEP] Sasha: For strings, `in` does a substring match, like finding a word in a sentence. [SEP] Sasha: Personally I'd be thinking a `set` would be the easiest way to go. [SEP] Demetrice: So will this work? Although i imagine there's probably a much better way [SEP] Sasha: Afraid not... `in` just doesn't do that. You'd need to loop over each letter and check it one at a time. [SEP] Demetrice: So if i'm looping then i can have it as one big string again, right? [SEP] Sasha: Yes [SEP] Clemmie: also you don\u2019t want to put the `= ''` in your method call. that is calling is_pangram with the  empty string every time [SEP] Clemmie: just call `is_pangram(sentence)` [SEP] Clemmie: :taco: <@Sasha> [SEP] Demetrice: Would this work? [SEP] Demetrice: Also, doing it this way there's no longer a reason to be wary of duplicates in alphabet, right? [SEP] Sasha: I don't think string subtraction is a thing, unfortunately, in your `test -= i` line. [SEP] Demetrice: Oh. Man [SEP] Demetrice: Also i'm getting a syntax error for 'is not in'. How do we say that in python? [SEP] Carlo: just \"not in\" [SEP] Carmen: ^ [SEP] Carlo: \"is\" is an identity test [SEP] Demetrice: So i rewrote it. But i think the second if statement is redundant, and doesn't solve the issue of things being out of order [SEP] Clemmie: <@Demetrice> you don\u2019t need to do all of the work you are doing  (perhaps) if a pangram is defined as having at least every letter from the alphabet, but can have duplicates (an maybe even other stuff) you don\u2019t need to create your alphabet. Conceptually all you need is to see if all of your test characters (the real alphabet) exist in  your sentence. If they do - return true, if you can\u2019t find one - return false [SEP] Clemmie: think about that a little and see if it changes your algorithm [SEP] Clemmie: Then we can talk about more performant, pythonic ways to do it, if you want [SEP] Alejandrina: This message was deleted. [SEP] Clemmie: you forgot `()` after your call to `lower` so `for i not in sentence` is trying to run on the build-in method `lower` not the string returned from a call to `lower()` [SEP] Lillia: That looks _much_ better [SEP] Lillia: I recommend removing the `else`, it's confusing. [SEP] Clemmie: But otherwise that is exactly what I was hoping you would get [SEP] Clemmie: If you want to go for really performant, take a look at `set` comparisons [SEP] Demetrice: Hey thanks you guys a ton for all the help [SEP] Demetrice: I'm not sure what set comparrisions are but i'll do some reading on it really quickly [SEP] Clemmie: ^ this, just return true at the end of the function. If it were false it would have already short-circuited and returned [SEP] Clemmie: :taco: <@Demetrice> for sticking with it [SEP] Lillia: I do venvs; PyCharm's pretty good about picking them up. [SEP] Lillia: Conda's probably \"better\". [SEP] Demetrice: :taco: <@Clemmie> :taco: <@Carlo> :taco: <@Sasha> :taco:<@Lillia>. Thank you all for the guidance [SEP] Demetrice: I'm actually gonna be here all day. I have so much ground to cover [SEP] Carlo: don't worry [SEP] Demetrice: :taco: <@Lloyd> <@Carlo> <@Sasha> <@Lillia> Even my taco syntax was incorrect lol [SEP] Lillia: Starting a new job in a couple weeks; I will have to introduce this taco thing.", "905": "Clayton: What is the recommened choices for configuring the python interpreter for pycharm.   venv or conda for envs and for the system interpreter", "906": "Granville: Thanks!", "907": "Nikki: I'm having a git issue :confused: [SEP] Hiroko: git got you?

[SEP] Lillia: Yeah try to unstash; theoretically you shouldn't have been able to commit the too-big file [SEP] Lillia: Oh `unstash` is equivalent to `pop`, if I understand what you're saying by `unstash` [SEP] Nikki: no stash found [SEP] Lillia: :grimacing: [SEP] Nikki: oh dear [SEP] Nikki: this is one of those moments you learn a hard lesson [SEP] Nikki: I've not done a commit in over a week [SEP] Lillia: Ouch [SEP] Lillia: <http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/> [SEP] Nikki: is there anything else you can think of to try?

You'll get the warning even though it's \"deleted\". Do `git reset --soft HEAD~2` and then re-commit what you want.

And it's supposed to be one of the easier ones [SEP] Demetrice: have any of you guys ever worked through the python track on <http://exercism.io|exercism.io>? [SEP] Maricruz: What's the recommended library for parsing xml these days? bs4? [SEP] Sasha: <@Demetrice> not that site in particular, but I've had fun with Advent of Code and Project Euler recently. If you're looking for a hint, the channel can probably provide one if you post the problem. [SEP] Demetrice: I just don't really know where to start with this one. i understand that i'm probably creating a class. But i don't know how to meet the requirements [SEP] Demetrice: None [SEP] Sasha: If you haven't already, have a look at the `random` library. It has some functions which will help. [SEP] Demetrice: So i imagined that i would use randint to meet the random requirement [SEP] Demetrice: But i'm not sure how to make sure they're unique. I guess i can do an if statement to where if they're equal to each other i have the program try again? [SEP] Sasha: Yeah, you'll need to keep track of all the live names to compare against. [SEP] Demetrice: Does this line of code mean anything to you? [SEP] Demetrice: The test sheet has it and i don't know what to make of it [SEP] Demetrice: name_re = r'^[A-Z]{2}\\d{3}$' [SEP] Demetrice: Is that the format to create the first random name assigned to each robot? [SEP] Sasha: Yeah, that's a \"regular expression\". It says there should be two uppercase letters followed by three digits. Python's `re` library can match strings against those types of patterns, though you don't have to use it here. [SEP] Demetrice: It sounds like it would make things easier tho, right? [SEP] Demetrice: Is that the pythonic way to meet that requirement? What i don't understand is that the test document doesn't have re imported [SEP] Sasha: Not really easier for you... it's good for checking the answers, but not creating the strings in the first place. [SEP] Demetrice: Okay that makes sense actually [SEP] Demetrice: It's looking to make sure it matches that format. But it's not going to create it on it's own thats my job [SEP] Sasha: Exactly. [SEP] Demetrice: So i guess i concatenate a string including random with all the numbers uppercased + rand int for the letters [SEP] Demetrice: But even after that i have to check to ensure it's unique [SEP] Demetrice: And then i do all this in the section of the code where i'm creating the class, right? [SEP] Demetrice: I think i'm too intimidated by it. I'm gonna give it a shot [SEP] Sasha: Baby steps. Start by writing a function to generate a random name. Then write some code to keep track of names and determine uniqueness. Then wrap it all in a class or whatever structure they want. [SEP] Demetrice: So is this a viable beginning? [SEP] Sasha: The concept is good, but multiplication of strings gets you an exact copy, like `'a' * 2` is `'aa'`, rather than an additional random choice. The `[0-9]` syntax isn't supported either. [SEP] Demetrice: Was i supposed to use () instead of []? [SEP] Demetrice: So i have to copy and paste? Is there a prettier solution to that? [SEP] Demetrice: This is where i am currently [SEP] Sasha: `randint()` takes two parameters, like `randint(0, 9)`. If you do `0-9`, you're subtracting. [SEP] Demetrice: Okay. I see that's goofy of me [SEP] Demetrice: So fixing that it looks ugly. But it'll do the first part of what we need, right? [SEP] Sasha: Almost. The `random.random()` function returns a number between 0 and 1. I think you want a different function to pick from a string of possibilities. [SEP] Demetrice: None [SEP] Sasha: Cool, that looks good. (Note you have `WKYZ` at the end of the alphabet.) [SEP] Carmen: Wow, that's a first. I just went to look at the random module to see what other options there are for choice (I'm pretty sure there's a \"choose multiple times\" option), and I got a 503. [SEP] Carmen: `Error 503 All backends failed or unhealthy` [SEP] Demetrice: I'm trying to continue working but when i begin an if statement statement it's indenting like 8 times as much as normal. Why would that be? [SEP] Sasha: Possibly an unclosed parenthesis in a previous line, so it's trying to continue that expression? [SEP] Carmen: `random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)` would help with DRY and code reuse. [SEP] Carmen: Ignore `weights` and `cum_weights`, and you should be good. [SEP] Natosha: And how do I fix that? [SEP] Demetrice: You might have to update your environment variables in settings [SEP] Carmen: Alternately, you might need to reinstall `python_dateutil` [SEP] Natosha: and to add, it says\n```\nNo metadata found\n``` [SEP] Demetrice: So i'm now here. Truth be told i'm really bad at writing classes. And i know the syntax is probably all kinds of wrong, but are we heading in the right direction? [SEP] Natosha: I tried to reinstall python_dateutil earlier but still I can't [SEP] Natosha: <@Demetrice> which env variables that I need to update? [SEP] Carmen: <@Demetrice> I would refactor that name generation into a class method, for clarity and less code duplication. [SEP] Candra: `pip install --upgrade python_dateutil` should update it [SEP] Carmen: Otherwise, that looks like a solid start, assuming it's generating names appropriately. [SEP] Carmen: Did you intend to have the names generation inside the __init__ constructor, or was it supposed to be outside the class? [SEP] Candra: self.name == name is an equivalence check, not an assignment, just FYI [SEP] Demetrice: Right it was only supposed one question mark. I think the meet the criteria for the test i want to have it inside the constructor [SEP] Natosha: <@Candra> still no luck [SEP] Demetrice: The default name is supposed to be what's assigned to the robot from the assembly line. So i don't think it's supposed to be something that happens when i call a method [SEP] Demetrice: I think it's supposed to be an attribute [SEP] Natosha: It affects the whole pip thing not just the ```python_dateutil``` [SEP] Natosha: It looks like a metadata is missing [SEP] Natosha: so it can't proceed [SEP] Candra: <@Natosha> in bash do `pip freeze | grep python_dateutil` and tell me what version it says [SEP] Natosha: <@Candra> I'm using windows [SEP] Candra: Do you have git bash for windows [SEP] Candra: or just do pip freeze [SEP] Candra: and look for the package [SEP] Natosha: yeah I do have ubuntu subsystem [SEP] Natosha: but the env that I created is in windows [SEP] Candra: well just do pip freeze and find the package name and version [SEP] Natosha: it's 2.7.5 [SEP] Candra: do `pip uninstall python_dateutil` and then `pip install python_dateutil==2.8.0` [SEP] Natosha: when I tried to uninstall the package [SEP] Demetrice: I need to make sure the global d_names updates. Is the return statement necessary? [SEP] Natosha: I'm getting the exception error [SEP] Candra: What is the exception [SEP] Candra: Copy what it says into here [SEP] Natosha: this are the last line\n```\n    with open(path, 'rb') as stream:\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '*\\\\envs\\\\data_analysis\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\python_dateutil-2.7.5.dist-info\\\\RECORD'\n``` [SEP] Candra: Oh wait do `pip install python-dateutil -U` [SEP] Sasha: <@Demetrice> No, the `return` isn't necessary. [SEP] Natosha: <@Candra> still has an error [SEP] Demetrice: Okay nice. So i now have a class named robot and each instance of it is going to generate a new default name in the format the test wants [SEP] Natosha: I tried creating a new virtualenv [SEP] Natosha: and install new packages and it works fine [SEP] Natosha: I guess the virtualenv is destroyed [SEP] Candra: Yeah was gonna say just recreate it [SEP] Natosha: yeah hahaha [SEP] Candra: That's what they're there for :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Natosha: just have to replicate the packages that I installed [SEP] Natosha: hahah, do you know how to remove an existing virtualenv? [SEP] Demetrice: I think i just don't know how to interpret the second set of instructions. So for the second half after i call the reset method it wants it to be a new name [SEP] Demetrice: But not follow any pattern? [SEP] Corey: I'm a newb, seems the while statement would fail with the first iteration. Is that correct? [SEP] Demetrice: Oh don't sorry. I'm really new too. yet  somehow i wanna be job ready in a few weeks [SEP] Demetrice: The while statement is only there to make sure that the value that's randomly generated is unique [SEP] Corey: Did you try .appending the default_name to the d_names list initially? [SEP] Demetrice: So while it's not unique i want the program to try again [SEP] Natosha: <@Candra> I got it. Thanks man for the help :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Natosha: <@Demetrice> sorry for interrupting your convo earlier [SEP] Demetrice: Oh no you're fine. I felt bad. That's why i tried to not type as much while you where going [SEP] Demetrice: I can understand how frustrating issues like that can be [SEP] Corey: <@Demetrice>     letters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n\n    d_names = []\n\n    default_name = random.choice(letters) + random.choice(letters) + str(random.randint(0,9))+ str(random.randint(0,9))+ str(random.randint(0,9))\n\n    d_names.append(default_name)\n\n    print(d_names) [SEP] Corey: <@Demetrice> See the list chained to the built-in append() function? :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Demetrice: Well so i'm writing this all as part of a class. so i don't really want to print anything [SEP] Corey: Oh, the print was just a test of the desired value [SEP] Corey: It's just part of your total script from before. [SEP] Demetrice: I get what you're saying. You're just saying that i should write the last line a little differently [SEP] Demetrice: I guess it would look better that way, Thanks [SEP] Corey: The first four initialize the list. [SEP] Corey: How many elements would you like to store in the list? [SEP] Demetrice: It's not a fixed number. It's just supposed to pass this test [SEP] Demetrice: Have you ever gone through the tests on <http://exercism.io|exercism.io>? They've all been pretty difficult for me so far [SEP] Corey: <@Demetrice> Enclose my line 4, the one employing the .append() function, in a loop to keep adding new values to your list.

You will need to save the messages before or after sending.

I have the ability to do my own work but just as an advice or guidence i ask this question at this channel as this channel name is HELP!! [SEP] Jennefer: <@Hiroko> Thank you so much, you saved me:hugging_face: [SEP] Hiroko: glad to help :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Hiroko: I\u2019m curious, how did you install that version? [SEP] Cheri: Yes, so essentially say I want to encrypt some data that came from a form in React. I want to encrypt it in Python (because of the implementation of what I\u2019m working with is in Python) [SEP] Cheri: So I literally have to run some functions at different stages [SEP] Clemmie: if so you will want to take a look at one of the python web frameworks for handling AJAX events and running the crypto algos you want. Take a look at any of django/flask/pyramid [SEP] Clemmie: Think carefully about what you are trying to do - the data will travel over the wire in plaintext [SEP] Cheri: Yes I have looked at that [SEP] Cheri: and it is not a solution that makes sense even when sending information over TLS [SEP] Jennefer: <@Hiroko> I've followed that guide:\n<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/install/#installing-official-release> [SEP] Cheri: I have to perform the encryption and re-encryption locally as I do not want the private key t o leave the system. [SEP] Clemmie: when you mean locally, you mean on the server or the client? [SEP] Cheri: Also I have the stack done in JS already so I don\u2019t want to re=do it [SEP] Cheri: Client [SEP] Clemmie: So, short of building a native app in python, you don\u2019t have any options [SEP] Clemmie: If you want it to work in-browser, it is js or nothing [SEP] Cheri: Essentially I input some data say my phone number, I want to input that into a python function locally and get the output then send that output over the network [SEP] Clemmie: You need a native python app for that [SEP] Cheri: Fair enough! [SEP] Cheri: Well thanks anyways! [SEP] Coleen: How can I import a module from a modules directory which is not a subdir of my source dir? [SEP] Ashley: <@Cheri> typically you would rely on the existing layers of encryption provided by things like HTTPS when you post form data to the server [SEP] Cheri: Yeah I was thinking of implementing TLS but that would still mean I have to send Alice\u2019s private key over the network and the plaintext and that is too risky. [SEP] Coleen: ie, my python file is in `/files/src/file.py` and it contains `from modules import mymod.py`. The module is in `/files/modules/mymod.py`. [SEP] Ashley: Look into public key cryptography. If it didn't work, we wouldn't use it [SEP] Coleen: I created `modules/__init__.py` but that doesn't seem to help. [SEP] Ashley: The technology is already there when using HTTPS, so you don't need to worry about it [SEP] Clemmie: <@Ashley> I think <@Cheri> is - he wants to encrypt with the client user\u2019s private key ultimately, and is right to not want to send that over the wire [SEP] Cheri: I am using a very specific type of public key cryptography called Proxy Re-Encryption that\u2019s why I need the functionality in the client side [SEP] Cheri: Exactly [SEP] Ashley: <@Coleen> you want to make a \"package\" that you can \"install\" into your python environment. You've got the right idea with `__init__.py`, but make sure your package structure makes sense. You can even make multiple packages if you like. The \"install\" basically puts a copy of the package into the python's `site-packages` folder, which is where it looks for third-party packages when you try to import them.\n\nJust a heads up, though. When you make a virtual environment, you're making a new copy of python that has its own `site-packages` folder. But that's a good thing. [SEP] Coleen: I am using a conda environment already, because I have some external dependencies. [SEP] Ashley: <@Coleen> conda can manage environments. But you should still make a package that can be installed, and then have conda install it to the environment it's managing for you [SEP] Coleen: I see, so the idea is to install my package into the same conda env? [SEP] Ashley: I'm unfamiliar with proxy re-encryption, so I won't be much help then :joy: [SEP] Cheri: Hahhaha no worries, essentially I just have to run some python code in a JS app [SEP] Cheri: I\u2019ll figure it out somehow! I\u2019m sure someone else has had the same issue at some point! [SEP] Cheri: hehehe thakns for the input tho!!\\ [SEP] Ashley: <@Coleen> you can make a \"package\" by having a folder with an `__init__.py` module in it and (usually) other python modules and packages as well. You can make it installable with `setuptool` and a `setup.py` file (this isn't usually inside your package, but is still bundled in the project's folder along with the package). A quick Google search should bring up a simple guide on how to make a `setup.py` file with `setuptools` [SEP] Coleen: Awesome, thanks <@Ashley>! [SEP] Ashley: No problem! Good luck! [SEP] Chelsey: I need to write some scripts but the machine they will run on only has python 2.6.6, and there's sadly no possibilty of getting 3.anything. They'll be fairly simple stuff, mostly string manipulation and spitting out .csv files for load elsewhere. Do I care about the version really, or is there anything I should know? I've not used 2.* at all to date - everything I have done has been python3.", "935": "Hilma: <@Mariah> this is a competition question!", "936": "Cheri: Hi! Does anyone have experience with running Python scripts within JavaScript. I am trying to implement some cryptography and I\u2019ve read that CryptoJS is terrible [SEP] Clemmie: Do you want a user to interact with the web/JS and then do crypto stuff in python?", "937": "Coleen: But how can I \"make\" the package?", "938": "Karoline: is there a possibility of at least getting 2.7.x?", "939": "Carmen: There have been multiple ways people have suggested how you should think about the problem to move towards a solution.\n\n\"the first step is to figure out your algorithm, just as pencil-and-paper steps. Forget about Python, but make sure you know how the problem is supposed to be solved at all.\"\n\"take an easy shape, and go one step at a time\n\n- what's your problem?\n- what is the desired outcome?\n- what do you already know?\n- what do you need to know?\"\n\nYou haven't showed us anything about what you've already tried, what parts you don't understand, any of the usual things that we need to help someone figure out their problems. Instead, you've been asking us to break it into small parts *for* you. We're more than happy to help solve specific problems you might have, but breaking up the overall problem into smaller tasks is part of the work of solving the problem. You have to be able to break things up into smaller tasks by yourself as part of programming. If you can't seem to do that for this problem, then you need to find a different problem. It's not that you're not cut out for Python or programming, you're just trying to solve a problem that's beyond your current skills, and you should find a different, easier problem to cut your teeth on and build up the mental skills you need to break up a large problem like this into smaller tasks. [SEP] Carmen: It might be worth looking into compiling it all into a single executable. You could sneak in 3.x in there that way, if that's a possibility. [SEP] Alvina: None [SEP] Alvina: TypeError: can't pickle _thread.RLock objects [SEP] Alvina: I believe I am getting this error because I am referencing a function in my loop - it works fine when outside of a class [SEP] Alvina: process_chunk is a separate function within the same class - any idea how I can reference it? [SEP] Melynda: Seems more like you're trying to serialize\u2026 something, when you shouldn't be. How are you executing that code? Celery or something like it (tasks runner)? [SEP] Alvina: Airflow operator [SEP] Alvina: but I first made the functions in a normal Python script / jupyter notebook to test it [SEP] Melynda: Ah, multiprocessing, I assume is what `mp` is? [SEP] Alvina: yes [SEP] Alvina: sorry [SEP] Alvina: I added more lines of the code for clarity [SEP] Alvina: None [SEP] Alvina: process_chunk is a function which is just sending compressed CSV files to a REST API [SEP] Melynda: &gt; Note When an object is put on a queue, the object is pickled and a background thread later flushes the pickled data to an underlying pipe. This has some consequences which are a little surprising, but should not cause any practical difficulties \u2013 if they really bother you then you can instead use a queue created with a manager.\nSource: <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/multiprocessing.html#pipes-and-queues> [SEP] Alvina: hm [SEP] Alvina: \"The solution, sadly, is just to use a function in the global namespace. You can still make it an instance attribute though, take a look:\" [SEP] Alvina: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32321324/pool-within-a-class-in-python> [SEP] Alvina: seems like that might be the approach I will need to take [SEP] Alvina: a bit messier but if it works then I'll be happy [SEP] Melynda: I think you need to make your iterable (job_zip) pickle-able, which it isn't at the minute since it's a bunch of itertools callables? [SEP] Alvina: moving the function outside of the class and then adding self.process_chunk = process_chunk to __init__ worked [SEP] Alvina: yeah - should I replace the job_zip? I can add a += count, and the hook, token, stream_id, and execution_id are all static [SEP] Alvina: None [SEP] Alvina: then chunks is just the output of that function which reads a big csv file and compresses it into 50-100MB chunks before sending it [SEP] Melynda: Here's what I was testing: <https://gist.github.com/d17e36c1674238725a8e9b06ef955c43>\nI don't think having the called method in a class in inherently _wrong_, but the iterable (and possibly all locals within the pool call?) must be pickleable. [SEP] Melynda: Weird, my indentation has gone mental in that gist [SEP] Melynda: In the `Incorrect` class, the iterable `job` is a bunch of functions, which can't be serialized. In the `Correct` class, it's just a bunch of strings that are processed by process_chunk. Make sense? [SEP] Melynda: Pass data into the pool, not functions or methods, and you should be fine. :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Alvina: wow, your example looks much nicer than my actual code haha. thanks a bunch [SEP] Alvina: yeah, I will test some changes [SEP] Melynda: Good luck! [SEP] Candra: Upon an exception using `requests` module, does the function always return `None` to the object? [SEP] Hiroko: so if you\u2019re not returning anything explicitly, the return type is `None` [SEP] Sasha: I would expect that `r` would remain undefined if an exception is thrown, since the interpreter jumps out of the `get()` call prematurely. [SEP] Demetrice: So i think the problem is my final while loop. I was able to test that words.split() creates a list for me. But i was wanting to do was add the first character of each of those list entries to result. However it's still returning everything [SEP] Sasha: The trouble is that your `for y in x` loop is completely inside your `while` loop, so it goes through the whole word before the `while` has a chance to stop it. [SEP] Lillia: Misread whoops [SEP] Sasha: A handy trick is that strings are addressable like lists, so `str[i]` is the `i`th character. [SEP] Demetrice: Right right so if i'm looking for the first character all i have to do is ask it to return str[0], right? [SEP] Sasha: Bingo. [SEP] Demetrice: So i had to change it to this because it was failing cases where the word started with not a letter. But now it's failing cases where there's a  hyphenated word like metal-oxide cause it'll miss the \"o\" I know i could iterate the whole string looking for the '-' but i'm not sure what i'd do after that. Is there a more beautiful solution? [SEP] Lillia: You may want to look into using <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha> [SEP] Carlo: <@Demetrice> you could remove non-letter characters, I guess? [SEP] Lillia: Just so you don't have to keep having the list of letters [SEP] Genesis: anyone know how to do that in sql? [SEP] Melynda: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; re.compile(r'[^\\w]').split('This is a test of oft-difficult magic')\n['This', 'is', 'a', 'test', 'of', 'oft', 'difficult', 'magic']``` [SEP] Jonas: That kind of thing is going to be almost impossible [SEP] Melynda: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join([word[0] for word in re.compile(r'[^\\w]').split('This is a test of oft-difficult magic')])\n'Tiatoodm'``` [SEP] Jonas: Ideally you'd model your database to not need queries like that. [SEP] Genesis: ya, it would be easy in code, but the problem is I am trying to do metrics in grafana, so its getting a little messy :wink: [SEP] Demetrice: Thanks! I was able to clean it up a bit with that. I thought there must have been a better way. So now my core code looks better. But i still need to think of a solution to that problem [SEP] Lillia: If I were you, I'd break this down into two parts: getting the list of words (without symbols), and appending the first letters. The second part is easy (you already did it). I'd look into splitting on multiple characters, for example. Split on both whitespace and hyphens. [SEP] Demetrice: Here i'll put it back in the main chat. I thought i had something but i might be on the wrong train of thought again [SEP] Demetrice: So now python is telling me it has an issue with the way i'm using isalpha. But i just tested that. I think it's issue is with something else i did. What i was thinking was i would replace the \"-\" with a white space then try to re-split it. That may not be ideal [SEP] Demetrice: the x.replace on line 7 should be x.split [SEP] Lillia: Do your replacement before anything else [SEP] Lillia: Because you are trying to split on those spaces [SEP] Lillia: :thumbsup_all: [SEP] Melynda: <@Demetrice> did my replies in this thread not work for you? <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1551286361985400> [SEP] Demetrice: Honestly i didn't even see that. It went up top for some reason. I'm looking at it now. It looks so much simpler than mine [SEP] Demetrice: You did it in one line of code. :anguished::upside_down_face: what does the [^\\w] mean?  How does it know how to look for words like that? [SEP] Lillia: It's \"word character\" in regex, it'll split on anything that isn't alphanum or underscore [SEP] Melynda: The technology is called regular expressions, often shortened to regex, or even `re` since that's the name of the module in Python. They're _super_ useful, though quite hard to read and write. There's _lots_ written about them online. :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Melynda: You can play with them on sites like <http://regexr.com/4987v|regexr.com/4987v> [SEP] Demetrice: I see. So that would really solve this problem instantly. I've been trying to fix my version too for practice but it's just not picking doing what i want. My logic must be off [SEP] Lillia: This looks like it will replace <http://regex101.com|regex101.com> for me, thanks! [SEP] Lillia: Do you still need `if y[0].isalpha():` if you've removed the hyphens? [SEP] Sasha: I think `replace()` returns a modified copy of the string, rather than changing the original. [SEP] Melynda: Indeed, remove line 3, change 4 to `for y in words.replace('-', ' ').split():` and it works [SEP] Lillia: Yeah you can just do `for y in words.replace('-', ' ').split():` [SEP] Melynda: Great minds think alike! :smile: [SEP] Lillia: I blame my slow corporate VPN :smile: [SEP] Demetrice: :taco: <@Melynda> <@Lillia> <@Sasha> [SEP] Demetrice: Thanks a bunch [SEP] Lillia: Yw! [SEP] Demetrice: Now in order to pass i need to make my result uppercase [SEP] Demetrice: But result.upper isn't working [SEP] Demetrice: I'm trying it at different stages of the code looking for the desired result [SEP] Melynda: Define \"isn't working\"? [SEP] Melynda: It definitely _works_: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; 'test'.upper()\n'TEST'``` [SEP] Demetrice: So i wanted it all in caps so i tried changing this to result += y[1]. to result += y[1].upper() [SEP] Demetrice: But it didn't seem to change anything [SEP] Demetrice: Oh i needed to change both i think [SEP] Lillia: You shouldn't have to reference `y[1]` anywhere anymore [SEP] Lillia: All your words will be alpha numeric only now [SEP] Demetrice: Yeah okay then some of this code is redundant hang on [SEP] Demetrice: Well i think i need it for this test case specifically. Because otherwise it'll return a blank space for the 3rd word \"The Road _Not_ Taken\" [SEP] Demetrice: \"The Road _Not_ Taken\" [SEP] Demetrice: The not is nested in underscores [SEP] Lillia: `split()` will handle that [SEP] Lillia: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; 'a  a'.split()\n['a', 'a']\n``` [SEP] Lillia: Oh you need to replace the underscores too [SEP] Lillia: Forgot you weren't doing that [SEP] Lillia: This is why you should use the regex solution, by the way. You can specify `[^a-zA-Z]` to split on all non-letters.", "940": "Candra: ```\ntry:\n    r = requests.get('<http://www.sdfkjagdlfbpd.com>')\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n    print(e)\nif not r:\n    print('requests returned None!')\n``` [SEP] Hiroko: functions/methods always return None by default [SEP] Demetrice: There we go, I think this is what i was looking for.

If you just want to skip non-matching chars then use `pairs.get(x, '')` - that will return the empty string as a default when the lookup fails [SEP] Clemmie: if you want it to fails, or return an empty string, or some other functionality when there is a mismatch, use a try except clause [SEP] Clemmie: None [SEP] Genaro: ahhhh awesome!

[SEP] Priscilla: not using a venv [SEP] Priscilla: all packages are installed [SEP] Cori: ok [SEP] Sasha: So I don't see a class definition anywhere.

Is there a way to do this with some kind of inheritance? Let me know if anything is unclear thanks! [SEP] Mica: the two files are queries specific to independent ES indexes [SEP] Lillia: I'm confused by ```I want to be able to have the queries being part of the instantiated class if possible without moving all of the query functions into the class itself?``` do these query functions already exist? [SEP] Lillia: Or is `first_query()` an example of one? [SEP] Mica: just an example and they do exist. I have one file that has the class defined with all the key components such as IP and port, and I've recently added the ability to parse indexes and doc_type to the class. I have to files containing queries for the ES using this Model, originally each query instantiated a new class instance and used that for the query. I was wondering if it would be possible to get around that by making the queries a part of the class without copy pasting them into the actual class code and making it some several hundred line file [SEP] Mica: so:\n```\nclass Foo:\n  ...\n\ndef query():\n  Foo().query()\n```\nis what i had [SEP] Mica: but I don't think it's right, though I could be wrong [SEP] Clemmie: I would say don\u2019t compromise clarity and readability for some amorphous idea that the file is \u201ctoo long\u201d if the queries are cognitively tied to the class, then make them part of it [SEP] Lillia: If all these queries rely on the same data (in this case, IP/port, indices, doc_types) then moving them into the class is probably the best option [SEP] Mica: :thumbsup: cheers guys, at least i think I'm moving it in the right direction (i think) haha [SEP] Mica: too much second guessing [SEP] Clemmie: If they are not, then you probably want something where the class sets up the connections and workflow, and then fires a query. You could have a method\n```\nclass Foo:\n   def run(query_function):\n        query_function()\n``` [SEP] Lillia: ^ was going to be my second suggestion [SEP] Clemmie: and call it with\n```\ndef a():\n    do_a_query_here....\n\nfoo.run(a)\n``` [SEP] Lillia: FWIW you can also go the other way around, where you pass the `Foo` object into the query function.

Would such a validation be unnecessary if the attribute is set internally by the class? [SEP] Lillia: Can't you do the validation in the method that's setting the new value? [SEP] Lillia: Getters/setters make the life of the caller easier, that's really it. [SEP] Lillia: Makes for less typing. [SEP] Lillia: I wouldn't add unnecessary boilerplate if you're already setting the value yourself. [SEP] Lillia: (I'll add a caveat, a setter _may_ be good if you use this validation in many places) [SEP] Lillia: Actually I take that back; using a setter for validation is a bit weird. [SEP] Clemmie: Validation on attribute change is a hard one. The client can still access the underlying attribute without calling the setter. It is kind of like front-end back-end validation. Good to do on the frontend for speed/clarity, but if you don\u2019t check on the backend also you will compromised [SEP] Clemmie: So, by all means validate on change, but you should also when the value is _used_ [SEP] Lillia: I would have `withdraw()` do the check. Adding a setter simply for validation is unneeded boilerplate. It doesn't make the life of the caller any easier. [SEP] Lillia: <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1551728154471100> [SEP] Lillia: For example, following your account example, you may want to do validation when a caller sets the actual account balance. [SEP] Lillia: Rather than having `account.setBalance(x)`, you can define a setter and simply do `account.balance = x` [SEP] Lillia: Your setter can do the same validation that `setBalance` would have done, but it makes the syntax cleaner for the caller. Does that make sense? [SEP] Lillia: You aren't expecting the caller to directly set the balance, correct? [SEP] Clemmie: linux or windows? [SEP] Ludie: macOS :smile: [SEP] Clemmie: ok, great, you have a terminal [SEP] Ludie: yes, i know python basics and for loops [SEP] Ludie: but not enough about json specifically [SEP] Clemmie: what is the value you need to change, and is it part of a string that is unique in each file? [SEP] Dominga: That makes sense.\n\nThat is correct. The caller would invoke the `withdraw` method of the account object, which would set the balance internally. [SEP] Lillia: Right; you already have methods that the caller will use. Those methods can do the validation just fine. [SEP] Dominga: Ahhh, so if my Atm class would set the balance directly, then it would make sense to create a setter? [SEP] Lillia: Correct!

[SEP] Ludie: Like this: `{\"language\": \"en\",\"country\": \"uk\"}` [SEP] Clemmie: you would need to do the line breaks, given what I showed you, if the line breaks are in the text [SEP] Clemmie: but! there are other ways [SEP] Ludie: i am scared about pasting line breaks into the terminal [SEP] Ludie: usually doesnt work out the way i want it to [SEP] Clemmie: you could use a json processor (there are a bunch, you can take a look for them) to flatten the file, then changeout the text, then use the processor to re-save them pretty printed [SEP] Clemmie: also the char `\\n` is the newline indicator (usually) so you would do `{\"language\": \"en\",\\n\"country\": \"uk\"}` [SEP] Clemmie: and also put the `\\n` in the replaced text and you would be ok [SEP] Ludie: nice! [SEP] Clemmie: that is if you wanted to deal with the file as is [SEP] Clemmie: just always make sure to make a backup copy before messing with it, and you will be fine [SEP] Clemmie: in `sed` you might need to escape control characters (link \\n) but you can figure that out quickly enough [SEP] Ludie: noted [SEP] Ludie: yes, i am a little familiar with escaping characters [SEP] Alvina: is there a lot of overhead opening a file as gzip as text compared to a normal file? [SEP] Ludie: s/ /g is to ground the changes ? and the start and end versions are always separated by a slash?

Compression is great and the io speed is good too", "1022": "Dominga: Hi,\n\nI\u2019ve been having some issues with class attributes and properties (python 3). I know how getters and setters are generally used and that it\u2019s the pythonic way to use the `@property` to achieve define getters and setters when they are required.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated. Sorry for the longish quesiton.\n\nNow my question is twofold:\n\nPart 1\nHow and why should I define the attribute:\n```\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        # or instead \n        self._name = name\n        # which is preferred and why?\n\n    @property\n    def name(self):\n        return self._name\n```\n\nPart 2\nWith the `@property` decorator, I can add some logic to setting an attribute after the fact. So if it has been publicly set like: `instance.attribute = some_value`, I can use a property to route this through a setter and check the if, for example, `some_value` is in a specific range.\n\nThis makes sense to me. However, what if want to use a setter as defined above, but indicate to the user that it is not part of the public API of the class?\n\nFor example, if I don\u2019t want client code to use a specific attribute, I\u2019d write `self._attribute`. How would I do this with property decorator? [SEP] Dominga: Hm, I thought it is more readable and contained in that class.\n\nI have an instance of an Account class, modeling a bank account. For that bank account, I have a balance attribute and a corresponding setter, that checks if it ever drops below 0. If it does, it raises a ValueError.\n\nI also have an Atm class which uses the account object and calls `account.withdraw(amount)` or `account.deposit(amount)`.\n\nTo me it seemed useful to have that \u2018data integrity\u2019 check inside the setter of the balance.

I have a lambda function that serves a ML model. It's meant to run daily. I want to ping my team's MS teams chat room with the status of the run (success, fail, traceback).

Things are moving fast. I personally try to find case studies (sometimes directly within AWS learning center/docs) and go over those. They describe real-world scenarios and their solutions.\n\nAs for your Lambda question, I'd imagine (without knowing what MS chat room is), that there is an endpoint (much like on slack) that you can just send the notification to. Question is -- can you do it (assuming the Lambda is in Python) asynchronously, without blocking the rest of it? Is it even important (since the notification is possibly the last thing the Lambda does)?\n\nIf the answer is yes, I'd find MS chat root endpoint you can send your notification to (much like Slack's webhooks) and not bother with an intermediary like SNS.", "1027": "Kara: *Intro*\n\nComing back to Python after a long hiatus, I have a couple of questions in the realm of application dependency management.

Both reside in the module `account.py`.\n\nAn instance of `Account` raises a `InsufficientFundsError` within a member method if a particular condition is met.\n\nIn my main module, I am importing: `from account import Account`. My code in the main method calls a method with an argument that raises the `InsufficientFundsError`.\n\nAnd it works. Now my question: Why does it? I thought I would have to import the custom exception as well, but it works without it, too. [SEP] Clemmie: <@Dominga> Is the code path that triggers the `InssufficientFundsError` getting run/tested? Python won\u2019t normally cause an error until it is encountered at runtime, at which point you will get a `NameError`. Another possibility is that you have the code path wrapped in a greedy except (such as `except: ...` or `except Exception: ...`) [SEP] Dominga: <@Clemmie> Thanks for the reply, and sorry for my late response.\n\nIt is being run and works as expected. I am using:\n```\ntry: \n    # something\nexcept InsufficientFundsError:\n    # something\n```\n\nThe error is raised by the account class in the account module and not within my code of the main module. Maybe that\u2019s why? I am not importing the entire module, but just the class though. Which is why I am confused. [SEP] Clemmie: So the snippet above is in your main module? Have you tested it to so that the error is actually raised by the account? If not then that `except` is not reached at runtime, and the `NameError` will not occur [SEP] Clemmie: put another way, run some code that will make `Account` raise that error in the main module, and then see if it still works [SEP] Dominga: I\u2019ve expressed myself unclear. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe exception is encountered at runtime and handled properly. The handler is in the account class. The main module just calls a void method of the account class. If as a result of this method, the account\u2019s attribute would be set below 0, the InsufficientFundsError is raised within the account class, by the account class.\n\nactual snippet (excluding docstrings for brevity:\n\n```\nclass Account(...)\n...\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        amount = abs(amount)\n        new_balance = self.get_balance() - amount\n        try:\n            self.set_balance(new_balance) \n        except InsufficientFundsError:\n            print(f\"Insufficient funds.

Sometimes a dev wants to be able to fiddle with one of the underlying libraries, as you would in develop mode. [SEP] Hildegard: the team harmony part is finding a single way of defining the dependencies that serves 1) the guy who doesn't care about the supporting libs, wants to treat them like blessed versions and is ok waiting 15 mins to pull in a new build, and 2) the gal who manually fiddles with PYTHONPATH for \"control\" because they need may need to work on all 15 libraries [SEP] Hildegard: doing `-e` in requirements.txt files gets close, but I think it would be ideal to specify things in `setup.py` and have a flag for dev power install for user 2 vs package install for user 1 [SEP] Ashley: interesting writeup, although selenium is more of a test automation tool, as it's meant to emulate user interaction.

[SEP] Sasha: <@Clayton> A docstring is a Python literal quoted string in a specific position, like the start of a function, which is available to the software at runtime for help commands, etc. A comment, using `#`, can be sprinkled anywhere in the code, but it's invisible except to a human reading those lines.

[SEP] Sasha: No, it's just fixed text, embedded in the program. Logging would be dynamic output. [SEP] Clayton: isnt the stack trace enough for troubleshooting errors ? [SEP] Sasha: Well, that will tell you where an error was encountered, but not what the code was doing or why.

[SEP] Sasha: No, it's just a note from the programmer explaining what they were thinking, etc. or clarifying something which works but might be confusing to understand how it works. [SEP] Clayton: comment = what the code does , docstring = why it it does what it does [SEP] Sasha: It's more like docstring = what this function does, why you might want to call it, and what the parameters mean. Comment = how the function was implemented, in case you need to change how it works. [SEP] Clayton: Ive been reading about it and i still dont see anything that really elevates it above comments [SEP] Sasha: The main difference is that it's accessible at runtime through `__doc__`, and is a standard place to look for documentation. [SEP] Clayton: i saw that, you access it through the ipyhon / interactive prompt.  why not just look at the script to see the docstrings.  just dont get really get it [SEP] Sasha: \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af [SEP] Hiroko: <https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/documentation/> [SEP] Hiroko: <@Clayton> :point_up:  [SEP] Sasha: Thanks, <@Hiroko>. I hadn't run across Doctest before... that's a cute hack. [SEP] Bethany: The access to docstrings also makes it so ide can easily show you docs of functions you're calling. The fact that it's part of the language means the tooling can all work with it. The comments are not as easily accessible programmatically [SEP] Bethany: Other languages don't all have a standard like this. It's big QoL improvement", "1054": "Hiroko: Consider documentation builders like Sphinx [SEP] Hiroko: &gt;&gt;&gt; Docstrings versus Block comments\nThese aren\u2019t interchangeable. For a function or class, the leading comment block is a programmer\u2019s note. The docstring describes the operation of the function or class", "1055": "Clayton: I think I don't know how to leverage the value of 'docstrings' [SEP] Clayton: Is it like the 'man' or 'cat' command in Unix ? [SEP] Candra: More like man than cat [SEP] Stan: <@Clayton> -- it's not like 'man' or 'cat'. Docstrings are a way of associating a help string with a class of function for example. It is possible to programmatically access the docstring using the `__doc__` property. So, it is easy to write code which fetches such docs. [SEP] Stan: manpages have a format, and are idependent of the tool; you could write standalone manpages and 'man' could show them to you as readable docs. Docstrings are designed to live along with your code; either as an explainer for the module (at the top of the file) ..or per class, function etc. [SEP] Stan: Tools like Sphinx which generate user-documentation, are able to parse through your code and pull out docstrings automatically. This makes it easy to generate API docs. Typical case would be a docstring mentioning it's arguments, return values, exceptions raised etc. [SEP] Stan: Example:\nLook at the docstring for Flask's application object from the code here:\n<https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/86bf9dca72cd188813e26ef5dd972101ef8983cf/flask/app.py#L72>\n\nThe restructured text (.rst) which Sphinx operates on has been asked to fetch info from the class and all its members.\n<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pallets/flask/master/docs/api.rst>\n```\nApplication Object\n------------------\n\n.. autoclass:: Flask\n   :members:\n   :inherited-members:\n```\n\nIn the generated API documentation, the content you see came from the docstring\n<http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/api/#application-object>\n\nBy embedding help as docstrings, you also have an advantage of keeping docs close to the code.

It communicates with the various drivers for each browser to control them either locally or remotely (it's all network requests, so you can have selenium talk to the drivers over a network if you want), and, ideally, it tries to simulate how a real person would interact with the website (albeit much, much faster). The browsers it controls are not headless by default, but some of them support being run headless and you can have Selenium spin up a headless instance if you tell it to do so.\n\nRegarding performance, a long, long time ago, ~in a world wide web far away,~ xpath used to perform better than normal CSS selectors, but even then, only in certain circumstances, and not by much. Nowadays, CSS selectors perform much better across the board. You should always try to use CSS selectors for a number of reasons (e.g. front end developer will be able to understand them easily, they're simpler and easier to write), but performance should not be a concern, especially if you're running e2e tests with selenium (it's already going to chug along relative to other types of tests, so shaving off .01 seconds of a 20 minute test run isn't really worth it). The _only_ time you should use XPATH is it you need some sort of logic in your locator that CSS selectors just can't do (and even then, there's often ways around it). For example, if you need to find an element that happens to have an element inside it with a certain attribute value, XPATH is needed, because CSS selectors can't traverse up the node tree to the parents/ancestors.

[SEP] Adolfo: no other logic at all [SEP] Eric: well, you can then only import the class *only* and still have access to the value pointed by DEFAULT_SETTING [SEP] Eric: <@Izetta> first off, i have never used selenium directly from python, mainly via robotframework and such .. but if the question was would using lxml be a good idea?  Afaik, and i might be very wrong - that probably wont work or if it does, it wouldnt probably provide any speed improvements. [SEP] Eric: because selenium would still be in the middle and for lxml to get its magic, you would still need to wait for within seleniun context for page ready (and any async requests that might trigger dom changes) and only then get the page source .. [SEP] Eric: and . afaik, you would be more interested in live dom than the just the html .. [SEP] Izetta: <@Eric>  what is robotframework  [SEP] Eric: so,atleat from my pov, lxml is probably not what you are looking for. [SEP] Eric: <https://robotframework.org/> .. opensource automation framework .. [SEP] Eric: people will hate my for saying this but essentially:  \"Its like cucumber but with different syntax and written in python\" [SEP] Izetta: <@Eric>  can I use it for web scraping  [SEP] Eric: mm yes ?  but it will still be using selenium underneath it :smile: [SEP] Izetta: <@Eric>  then, I look into it  [SEP] Eric: so if you are familiar with sele &amp; python, robot itself wont add much except extra layer of abstraction .. *but* if not, keyword based automation might be a good fit. Depending in your requirements. [SEP] Izetta: <@Eric>  yeah, I am pretty familiar sele &amp; python [SEP] Eric: while i like people getting introduced to rf,  i dont think you will get any extra features from using it [SEP] Ashley: <@Izetta> Selenium is actually a _terrible_ scraping tool. It's built to work like a user, so it will be slow in many areas, and refuse to cooperate in others. (e.g. if an element has text, but isn't \"visible\", selenium will tell you it has no text). Using a full browser in general is also super slow, so you may want to explore other options. Robot is also a testing framework, so it's not really gonna offer you anything [SEP] Eric: testing &amp; *rpa* tool :slightly_smiling_face:", "1085": "Izetta: <@Ashley> hey, I\u2019m not using selenium for test purposes, I using it to make web scraper", "1086": "Nieves: Selenium sucks.

It's not a selenium issue [SEP] Karoline: I mean it is in the sense that they could get it, and choose not to.   I've seen them reply on issues that it's not what the tool is for as if it were some sort of philosophical issue. [SEP] Ashley: Aside from that, it's geared towards behaving as a user so you can test from as close to a user's perspective as you can in automation. Users don't care about return codes [SEP] Karoline: Right, but it's not a user.  It's a machine. [SEP] Ashley: If there's a problem, it should be evident from other things [SEP] Karoline: And lots of people have the use case of needing the return code. [SEP] Ashley: It's a machine meant to behave like a person [SEP] Ashley: Developers have uses, sure [SEP] Karoline: I don't interact with my browsers via xpath [SEP] Karoline: so that ship has sort of sailed lol [SEP] Joette: you're not clicking around with a cursor like some kind of monster, are you?? [SEP] Ashley: That's not really a fair argument [SEP] Karoline: it is - because it's precisely my point.  it's a philosophical argument rather than a practical argument, and one that falls apart under cursory inspection. [SEP] Ashley: It's a middleman between code and user. There's no magical means of a computer behaving exactly like a user in a predicable and deterministic manner [SEP] Karoline: right.  so it's useful to be able to use these signals to avoid needing magic [SEP] Ashley: If you care about the status code, why are you trying to use Selenium? Why not hit the API directly? [SEP] Karoline: what API?  like use curl? [SEP] Karoline: or requests or something? [SEP] Ashley: Yeah [SEP] Ashley: The API for the backed, whatever form that takes [SEP] Karoline: many websites don't have a backend API [SEP] Ashley: I'll rephrase [SEP] Ashley: Why don't you hit the website's server directly? [SEP] Ashley: Why bother going through the browser? [SEP] Joette: I get the objection here, b/c you may be checking status based on specific input added via the browser [SEP] Karoline: because sometimes the most reliable way to get data from a site is to be as close to a user as possible. [SEP] Joette: \"For a logged in user, after do X and then Y and then Z verify that the resulting status code is XXX\" [SEP] Joette: that oughtn't be the primary test, but you may want to check that too [SEP] Ashley: You can easily get around that by grabbing the cookies/user agent from the browser, and using them in your request [SEP] Joette: verify both the visual result, e.g. error message, _and_ that the server responds with a specific code in _that_ status [SEP] Joette: but if you're _already doing these tests_ [SEP] Joette: the prescribed solution is to use testing middleware [SEP] Karoline: from which browser, the one driven by selenium?  that's sort of rube goldberg-esque [SEP] Ashley: Selenium drives the browser, not the other way around [SEP] Karoline: that's exactly what I said? [SEP] Ashley: Sorry, sent before your edit [SEP] Karoline: ah [SEP] Karoline: in the end I think I ended up parsing the performance logs for it [SEP] Nena: basically need to write a wildcard, which os handled by a func saying bad input or proceding with next data [SEP] Ashley: If you're running e2e tests, checking the status code is more about testing implementation than behavior. You should be looking at what impact that has on behavior, rather than just checking it returns \"200\"/\"404\"/\"500\"/etc [SEP] Ashley: If you _really_ need that response status code, you can also just go through a proxy [SEP] Karoline: Not everybody is using selenium for e2e tests. [SEP] Ashley: I know, hence my comment about the proxy [SEP] Karoline: the proxy is a huge hassle, the performance logs route isn't too bad when you figure it out - I've been meaning to put up a blog post on it [SEP] Karoline: the big issue of course is that since there's a philosophical opposition to it, I wouldn't be shocked if this will break at some point [SEP] Karoline: because that's happened in the past [SEP] Ashley: The proxy is actually pretty easy to set up. Someone even made a python package for it, `browsermobproxy` [SEP] Ashley: What would break? [SEP] Karoline: my setup was containerized so that was a bit weird as my selenium client and the headless chrome instance were in different containers.  I imagine it could be setup, but it was more effort figuring it out than the performance log route [SEP] Sasha: <@Nena> Have a look at `collections.defaultdict`, which allows you to have a default value for missing dictionary keys. [SEP] Ashley: I mean what would break as a result of it being a philosophical opposition? [SEP] Karoline: It's just less than a priority, with approaches in the past messages I've seen on the web seemed to almost relish taking the ability to do it away. [SEP] Karoline: So who knows - but there have been other ways to do it and they've been removed/stopped working and the general response is just \"welp\" [SEP] Ashley: So you mean their opposition may break [SEP] Karoline: I mean techniques currently used to get the return code.  But if we want to continue the conversation probably should go to #testing_ [SEP] Jenice: wow selenium doesn't provide a status code? What does it tell you if you go looking for an element but the server responded with a 503 or something? [SEP] Sasha: You might run into a little weirdness since you want to have a function as the value, which `defaultdict` might interpret as a constructor instead of the value itself. So you might need to wrap that in a `lambda`. [SEP] Nena: running by the docs, will work something out. Thanks again for the guide. [SEP] Ashley: It would tell you the element is not found [SEP] Karoline: Probably best for us to take this to #testing_ [SEP] Ashley: Yeah [SEP] Karoline: Which for some reason doesn't autolink :disappointed: [SEP] Eric: Interested to read if you find the time to write it :) [SEP] Eric: I know its a stretch but care to give out ideas what mobproxy can do ?

[SEP] Jonas: that being said, you would avoid specifying those types. Python objects have a `__hash__` method that returns \"something that can be hashed\", which in cPython is an integer [SEP] Jonas: So there isn't much reason to not just accept any \"hashable\" object as the key [SEP] Jonas: in that case, the code would be [SEP] Jonas: ```\nfrom typing import Hashable, Any\n\nclass HashTable:\n    \"A horribly simple HashTable implementation.\"\n    def __getitem__(self, key: Hashable) -&gt; Any:\n      raise NotImplementedError()\n\n   def __setitem__(self, key: Hashable, value: Any):\n      raise NotImplementedError()``` [SEP] Jonas: If you want your hashtable to be a 'true' Mapping implementation, you'd just do this: [SEP] Jonas: ```from collections.abc import MutableMapping\nclass HashTable(MutableMapping):\n     pass```\n\nyou'd then need to fill in the 5 special methods documented here: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections-abstract-base-classes> [SEP] Jonas: Those are methods to get the length, iterate all keys, delete, set and update items.

[SEP] Hiroko: DI is used to dynamically bind dependencies based on a configuration [SEP] Hiroko: with java, you would need it because its a statically typed language [SEP] Hiroko: so you can inject dependencies at runtime, rather than compiletime [SEP] Hiroko: with dynamic languages like python, well.. its dynamic [SEP] Hiroko: so you don\u2019t need that injection, because its already built in the language features [SEP] Carlo: well... you don't need the concept of a dedicated \"DI container\" that much indeed [SEP] Carlo: as a general pattern though DI can help a lot with respecting IoC [SEP] Ted: from what i understand in the context of java you would use DI, but in python can i not just import it?

Python will catch the error, since it's in a `try` block, and then see if you want to catch that particular error by checking your `except` blocks in sequence (much like if/elif/else blocks). Every class in Python has a linearized chain of ancestors. This linearization is determined through a process called \"Method Resolution Order\" (MRO), which can be tricky, but there's a great talk by Raymond Hettinger called \"Super Considered Super\" which does a great job of explaining it. With the MRO chain established, Python can quickly and easily check to see if you want to catch that error [SEP] Kendra: and looks if class in `except` is in `ChildError`'s `__bases__` [SEP] Carina: There\u2019s also this, which is a bit tough to read but technically how the MRO sausage is made: <https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/> [SEP] Kendra: ```In [1]: class ParentException(Exception): pass                                                                          \n\nIn [2]: class ChildException(ParentException): pass                                                                     \n\nIn [3]: exc = ChildException()                                                                                          \n\nIn [4]: exc.__class__.__bases__                                                                                         \nOut[4]: (__main__.ParentException,)``` [SEP] Ashley: In terms of your example, it would be caught (assuming you raised the exception in the try block) because the child exception _is_ its parent in a certain sense. It's just an extension on the parent [SEP] Ashley: If python determines that you didn't want to catch that error, it just lets it get raised as if it wasn't in a try block [SEP] Kendra: in approximation it's like doing `isinstance(exc, SomeException)` [SEP] Tasha: but this type of i inheritance only works with Exceptions..? [SEP] Kendra: all classes [SEP] Tasha: ``` class Parent():\n    pass\n  \nclass Child(Parent):\n    message = \"hello\"\n    \nprint(Parent().message) ``` [SEP] Tasha: ``` Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/sessions/7ceb9d9608012ec8/main.py\", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;\n    print(Parent().message)\nAttributeError: 'Parent' object has no attribute 'message' ``` [SEP] Tasha: I know this is not the same [SEP] Ashley: As <@Kendra> said, this is all classes in Python. It's just how inheritance works. Python needed a way to linearize inheritance in the event that a class inherits from multiple classes at once, so they came up with MRO. MRO can also be utilized for things like dependency injection, which is fairly advanced, but very useful [SEP] Ashley: <@Tasha> changing the child does not change the parent [SEP] Tasha: ok greast [SEP] Ashley: That's part of the reason you would inherit [SEP] Ashley: Think of a class called \"Fruit\" [SEP] Tasha: ok [SEP] Ashley: It has all the info you could have about, and all the things you could do with a generic fruit, but it isn't any fruit in particular [SEP] Tasha: right [SEP] Ashley: Then inherit from it and make an Apple class [SEP] Ashley: That class gets all the things from the Fruit class, but has the opportunity to add or adjust things [SEP] Tasha: ``` class Fruit():\n    taste = \"sweet\"\n    color = \"defualt\"\n\nclass Apple(Fruit):\n    color = \"red\" ``` [SEP] Ashley: Close [SEP] Ashley: Not all fruits are sweet, but you get the idea [SEP] Tasha: ok [SEP] Tasha: so how do i use Fruit() [SEP] Tasha: and some how call all its child classes [SEP] Ashley: Why would you want to? [SEP] Tasha: except Fruit as err [SEP] Tasha: lol [SEP] Ashley: The parent doesn't  usually need to know about its descendents [SEP] Tasha: yes thats right [SEP] Ashley: But yes [SEP] Ashley: That's how you would do it for an exception [SEP] Tasha: i havent come across this before in 5 years of developing lol [SEP] Tasha: i have studied IOC container DI [SEP] Tasha: SOLId [SEP] Ashley: You haven't come across inheritance in 5 years of development? [SEP] Tasha: etc [SEP] Tasha: functional, erlang [SEP] Tasha: and i dont know how this works lol [SEP] Tasha: i understand inheritance [SEP] Tasha: solid principles [SEP] Tasha: etc [SEP] Tasha: but i dont understand how python Exceptions reach down to the child classes [SEP] Ashley: Oh, yeah, they don't [SEP] Ashley: The parent class can be completely unaware that it has descendants [SEP] Tasha: I have read that Python's inheritance tree goes upwards untl the base class [SEP] Ashley: Python in the one checking that the exception that was raised inherits from any of the exception classes you want to catch [SEP] Clemmie: They don't, and it isn't exception specific. When you had except parent it caught child because child inherited from parent. Python, via the mro, knows that  [SEP] Clemmie: It is the reverse if what you said really. Child knows it inherits from parent,but parent doesn't necessarily know what inherits from itself [SEP] Ashley: there's \"old\" style classes, and \"new\" style classes. I believe in Python 3, old style classes don't exist anymore, but basically, the difference is that in old style classes, they don't extend all the way up to the `object` class, and in new style classes, they do [SEP] Tasha: can you give me an example outside of Exceptions whereby  python can expose a classes child /sub classes? [SEP] Ashley: that doesn't really happen often [SEP] Ashley: you'd have to implement that yourself [SEP] Clemmie: So, effectively, when you did except parent, child says \"I am a type of parent\" and is caught [SEP] Ashley: like we said, the parent is unaware of the children [SEP] Tasha: ahh great thanks [SEP] Clemmie: Using parent/child as the terms also confuses it a bit [SEP] Ashley: yeah [SEP] Tasha: super / sub classes [SEP] Ashley: <@Tasha> make a class that inherits from a few other classes, and then call `__mro__` on it (I think that's the attribute) [SEP] Tasha: ok cool! [SEP] Ashley: that might clear it up a bit [SEP] Clemmie: Like apple knows it is a fruit, and will respond as such, but fruit doesn't need to know what fruits there are [SEP] Tasha: thats it! [SEP] Tasha: haha now i understand [SEP] Tasha: So python must be looking at any class that extends from Exception , right down the tree of subclasses? [SEP] Ashley: yep. Python basically sees you're trying to catch `Fruit`, and goes `if Fruit in Apple.__mro__: # actually catch it` [SEP] Ashley: oh, no it doesn't really care about all classes that extend from exception [SEP] Ashley: it pretty much does `if Fruit in Apple.__mro__: # actually catch it` [SEP] Tasha: ahh so its looks here: SubClassException(Exception) &lt; -------- here [SEP] Ashley: because it saw `catch Fruit` [SEP] Ashley: kind of [SEP] Ashley: MRO is a lot more complex than what's listed in there [SEP] Tasha: ok [SEP] Tasha: is this in Java? [SEP] Ashley: watch Super Considered Super, and it should explain it pretty well [SEP] Ashley: Java doesn't have this [SEP] Ashley: Java actually has what I think is called a \"death triangle of inheritance\" [SEP] Ashley: or something like that [SEP] Tasha: I wondered how my boss new how this works, he isnt great at all at Python, he comes from Java/ ruby [SEP] Ashley: basically, multiple inheritance can go awry very quickly in Java [SEP] Clemmie: Well, does java have what exactly? [SEP] Ashley: Python avoids that problem with MRO [SEP] Tasha: I just wondered how he knew straight away i can just use our custom parent exception class and all the sub classes would be caught as well [SEP] Tasha: its really a head teaser [SEP] Tasha: brain teaser, rather lol [SEP] Tasha: but thanks guys [SEP] Tasha: explained very well [SEP] Tasha: im going to quiz him tomorrow on the technicals of this [SEP] Ashley: ah found it [SEP] Tasha: im sure he would have no idea or MRO [SEP] Ashley: Java has what's called the \"deadly diamond of death\" (I'm not making that up) [SEP] Tasha: ]haha [SEP] Tasha: love it [SEP] Raguel: I want to know etymology of that phrase now [SEP] Ashley: it's a diamond of inheritance [SEP] Ashley: and it kills your program dead [SEP] Ashley: deadly death [SEP] Clemmie: I mean, java does have generics, which can get you close to mro like behavior, in a staticly typed, verbose way [SEP] Tasha: ok [SEP] Tasha: rightmost depth first resolution [SEP] Tasha: does that mean literally 'right'? lol [SEP] Clemmie: The best thing about the mro is the deterministic way it identifies in what order things are inherited when using multi-inheritence, based on the declaration order. (Which is the deadly diamond issue) [SEP] Tasha: thank god i never learnt Ruby [SEP] Tasha: haha [SEP] Tasha: yes just read it uses the base class's tuple order [SEP] Clemmie: Exactly [SEP] Tasha: but Ruby's : rightmost depth first resolution [SEP] Tasha: lol [SEP] Tasha: is that literally : 'right' [SEP] Tasha: so it would always take the right side of the diamond? [SEP] Tasha: before the left class [SEP] Tasha: sorry getting off topic [SEP] Clemmie: It will always look first to the rightmost defined class for a method/variable resolution [SEP] Tasha: ok [SEP] Tasha: so then it's a form or module resolution [SEP] Tasha: method, rather [SEP] Tasha: yes [SEP] Tasha: man thanks so much\\ [SEP] Tasha: !

All of the issues you were running into were syntax errors. It would likely be a good idea to check out the tutorial on the official docs site: <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html> \u2014 The specific syntax errors you had were: 1. Invalid/inconsistent tabs; Python uses tabs to denote blocks of code (effectively \u201cscope\u201d), whereas other languages use things like curly braces (`{` and `}`) to denote blocks of code. 2. The `assert` keyword has a specific invocation pattern. You need an expression to assert, and more generally `assert`ing an object will _evaluate_ your expression in an attempt to confirm that it is \u201cTruthy\u201d (i.e. using `bool(expression)` will return `True`), otherwise it will raise an `AssertionError`. [SEP] Carina: In your case specifically, you\u2019re using the python shell, which is an interactive program where you type code directly into the interpreter. It\u2019s still a python interpreter and still requires valid python syntax, so tabs are still a requirement. The tricky thing about the python shell is that it\u2019s not really practical to build any significant/major behavior through the interactive interpreter, which is why I suggested putting your code in a file instead and running it using the `python my_tests.py` command. [SEP] Carina: Further, the `if __name__ == '__main__': test_all()` line is what tells python what code to run. This is more or less standard boiler plate for python applications/code, it\u2019s somewhat analogous to other language \u201cmain\u201d functions. For example, in java you\u2019d use `public static void main(String[] args)`, in C it\u2019s `int main()`, etc. etc. [SEP] Carina: I hope that\u2019s clear, but definitely let me know if I can clarify this further.

You may need to implement your own color-space conversion on a pixel-by-pixel basis instead of relying on OpenCV for that. Alternately, can you perform the conversion on the original square-pixel image first before the hex step? [SEP] Sasha: In general, I would not expect things to \"just work\" between OpenCV and the hex-image libraries. [SEP] Josef: what do you mean by performing the original sqaure-pixel image first? [SEP] Sasha: Well, you appear to be calling `cvtColor()` to convert the image to grayscale. Can you do that on the original JPEG instead? [SEP] Josef: yes of course, so you mean to say I perform OpenCV processing first before converting the image to hexagonal pixel? Doesn't it change the main goal of hexagonal image processing where we convert image to hex then do some image processing after? [SEP] Sasha: Depends on what your goal is, I guess. But the main point is that you probably shouldn't expect OpenCV to operate on hexagonal images, so you may have to implement your own image processing. [SEP] Josef: How can I make a function where I can Apply a 2DFilter on an image? Can I do that ? please help. I want it to be Like this one \"cv2.filter2D(img, cv2.CV_8UC3, g_kernel)\" because I already have the filter for hexagonal Image but the problem lies on applying the filter on the resampled image. [SEP] Sasha: No idea, I'm afraid. You know a lot more about hexagonal images than I do. It's not at all obvious how to generalize 2D filters to hex pixels since the axes are no longer orthogonal. Sounds like some math may be necessary to figure that out. [SEP] Josef: Yeah I think so too. Thank you sir. :slightly_smiling_face:", "1223": "Sima: what's going on.

I'm no expert in python (yet :stuck_out_tongue: ) and I have no idea how to best tackle this [SEP] Shawana: count(category_list, word) [SEP] Bethany: <@Lucius> this problem is called 'categorization' or 'classification' [SEP] Shawana: so you had to use lists of words for your categories. and you could iterate over every word in your sentence, or you build some comprehensions around that [SEP] Bethany: you want to classify sentences as belonging to a particular 'class' such as \"fitness\", \"fashion\", ... [SEP] Lucius: sounds about right yeah :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Bethany: great! This can be relatively complicated or straightforward. If you want good accuracy, it will be very complex. But what you describe could work for simple cases [SEP] Bethany: you can do things like split the words in the sentence, and check for overlap with your keyword file [SEP] Lucius: yeah I've noticed that. Whenever I was google'ing these things I would end up in machine learning :stuck_out_tongue: Which is way out of my comfort zone atm [SEP] Bethany: yes this is usually done by neural nets/deep learning nowadays [SEP] Shawana: so, use count() and iterate [SEP] Bethany: try your approach first and see if it works [SEP] Bethany: look into `collections.Counter` [SEP] Lucius: sounds good! Thanks to the both of you for your input! [SEP] Bethany: if you find it's not enough, feel free to ask <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> [SEP] Lucius: :thumbsup: [SEP] Lucius: but i guess this approach would require me to use multiple keywords files/collections right? [SEP] Jorge: the tricky thing may be using a file as a database for niches -&gt; keywords [SEP] Contessa: The trick will be to automatically group the words, since it is near impossible to know these groups of words beforehand. I'd probably look into some hierarchical clustering, prior to a great layer of normalization (remove words like \"the\", \"a\", put all verbs in present form, transform plurals into singulars, etc) [SEP] Lucius: sounds like i found myself quite a challenge :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes_and_hand_covering_mouth: [SEP] Genesis: there are some natural language processing libraries that could help: <https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html>", "1263": "Bethany: look into topic modelling", "1264": "Angila: Sorry if this is too broad, but I'm looking for some guidance with deployment options. I've been writing various Python utilities for a few years and I'm now gearing up to deploy my first flask app. I'm looking into various options and I'm having some trouble determining why I'd choose one option over another. It's my hope that I can share a little about what I'm trying to do and someone can point me in the right direction. I'm specifically interested to hear about the preferred way to get my code onto the production server (and updated as needed) and what I should be using to run this in production. [SEP] Angila: This is a very low traffic app that will be hosted locally on a centos box and only accessible on our network. It's a simple web-based UI that take a JSON file as an input and returns a tar file containing 10 or so files (XML, various text files, epub). The code is managed in a git repository. [SEP] Claudine: If it's small and being hosted locally you could probably just install Apache and WSGI_Mod and do it all yourselff [SEP] Angila: I've considered just pulling from the repo to get the code on the server, but that doesn't feel like the right call. I've looked into setuptools, but that seems like it's intended to solve a different set of problems. [SEP] Carlo: to me it actually sounds like the right call [SEP] Joette: one simple option: pull into a \"cache\" folder, and copy into a release folder [SEP] Claudine: yea I'd just clone the repo to the server then point your apache+wsgi_mod at your repo [SEP] Joette: by using release folders (including updated virtualenvs in each release folder) you can roll back to deployments [SEP] Claudine: you can `git pull` to update the repo, or hook up some sweet git hooks to do it automatically when your upstream is updated [SEP] Carlo: if you feel fancy you could even setup a quick webhook -&gt; git pull on your server down the line [SEP] Carlo: but I wouldnt do much more [SEP] Joette: with something like Fabric setting it up is close enough to trivial [SEP] Carlo: just as <@Claudine> said, git clone and pull as needed feels just fine for something like this [SEP] Angila: Thank you. This is all helpful. I get the feeling I've been trying to overcomplicate things [SEP] Carlo: don't we all :wink: [SEP] Claudine: no problem at all [SEP] Claudine: took me a heck of a time to figure out wsgi_mod when I first started trying to host my own stuff [SEP] Carlo: same... [SEP] Angila: I've been using Apache for such a long time I think I was getting excited about using something else. But if it ain't broke, don't fix it [SEP] Claudine: in that case you could learn nginx :smile: [SEP] Angila: funny you mention that\u2026 [SEP] Claudine: i still haven't tried nginx, I've had to use Apache so much for work that's what I stick with since it's familiar [SEP] Carlo: I've used nginx as a reverse proxy in docker-compose setups and... thats pretty much it [SEP] Angila: prior to posting here my plan was to use nginx as a reverse proxy to hit my app running on gunicorn [SEP] Carlo: well you _could_ still do that even with the simple git based deploy [SEP] Carlo: probably wont make a noticeable difference in your usecase though [SEP] Angila: i initially wanted to use git hooks, but our systems security folks objected. i believe because the repo is outside our network [SEP] Angila: i think apache and wsgi_mod is what I'm going to do. that way i won't be the only person here who can support it. i do love going on vacation. thanks again!", "1265": "Nova: Hello, I am using python 3.4 for my argparser cli command and found that allow_abbrev doesnt exist below 3.5? can you suggests any alternative to solve issue?", "1266": "Carmen: <@Angila> Just to add another option to your list of ways to do deployment, if you're setting up the copy of code on the server as a git repo, you can add a git remote to your local repo and just push directly to that remote when you want to do a deploy. [SEP] Carmen: If you have a bunch of other things that need to happen when you do a deploy, definitely look into Fabric. But for just pushing out code updates, git push works just fine if your target is also a git repo. [SEP] Angila: <@Carmen> That's an interesting idea about setting up the deployment server as a git remote. I like that. And I'm just taking a look at Fabric. This could get interesting. Thanks! [SEP] Carmen: Caveats include: That machine must be reachable from your local machine (otherwise git push won't be able to reach it), others will need to set up the same remote to be able to deploy (not a big deal if you have appropriate documentation), and you somewhat lose out on having the deployed code be a tagged branch (you can tag it, sure, but the remote repo has to be a checkout of a branch that you can push to, like master, not a checkout of a detached head like a tag gives you). [SEP] Carmen: There may be one or two other things that my brain isn't remembering offhand. [SEP] Angila: Those first two aren't a problem. And the lack of tagging isn't a deal breaker but it's good to be aware of. I really like that once I've set it up as a remote and others add it, they'd be able to push updates", "1267": "Wen: hi folks. here\u2019s an interesting question. i have a script that is doing some data processing, but i don\u2019t want it to take all the cpu useage and make me unable to do much more. so is there a way to throttle cpu use of a script so it runs over longer time but doens\u2019t make cpu cry.

[SEP] Sasha: The typical solution there is to set the priority (\"nice\" level) of the Python process so the OS will run it only in idle cycles. So, not something that you do within your script itself, but in how you run it. [SEP] Deon: I don't understand how this works conceptually, but i'm interested since I just finished a nginx- gunicorn - flask app [SEP] Clemmie: it is a little overkill, but you could run it in a virtual machine that has been allocated only a % of cpu <@Wen> [SEP] Wen: that could work. if i can find a very easy way to create VMs [SEP] Wen: thanks. yeah that seems like the most practical solutions so far.", "1268": "Hayden: Anyone ever use ButterCMS with Django?", "1269": "Joette: what are you trying to do?

[SEP] Stacy: argparse line: `parser.add_argument('-s', '--symbol', nargs='+', help=\"stock symbol\", required=True) ` [SEP] Stacy: `symbol = args.symbol` [SEP] Sasha: I'm finding it a little difficult to follow your question. Can you show me what `symbol` prints as when returned by argparse, and what you want it to be instead? [SEP] Stacy: yep one sec [SEP] Stacy: it is difficult, i use awful variable names, sorry.

[SEP] Sasha: Sorry, was that clear enough to indicate how to fix things, or should I be more explicit? [SEP] Stacy: ughhhh. i got it. so this is what I ended up with. so after fixing variable `s` it was the `#v.insert(0, symbol)` line breaking things.\n\n```\n            s = '\"{}\"'.format(symbol[0])\n            v[0] = '\"{}\"'.format(v[0])\n            v[0] = '{}'.format(v[0])\n            #v.insert(0, symbol)\n            v.insert(0, s)\n            v = \",\".join(v)\n            print(v)\n```\n\ntook me a minute after your response but that was the nudge I needed.

By the way, the `v[0] = '{}'.format(v[0])` line doesn't do anything in this case, since it's just re-formatting the value as itself.

[SEP] Juliana: So why are devs so intense about only coding few lines and not separating it all out like i had? [SEP] Carlo: hmm because at some point you just get what you're reading and don't _need_ to split it out to understand [SEP] Clemmie: Some of it comes from historical language requirements, some about maintainability - it is all logically related to that operation, and I don\u2019t need any of the values there for any other operations [SEP] Juliana: Do i need to return anything in that function? [SEP] Clemmie: That is a very deep question [SEP] Clemmie: For readability you should probably return teams_with_player_rosterss [SEP] Clemmie: Strictly speaking, you don\u2019t have to, but that is because dicts are mutable and how python passes parameters - fairly advanced stuff [SEP] Juliana: everytime i run the file it has a syntax error at the end of line 2 inside the function [SEP] Clemmie: that is surely possible - i typed it in textEdit. show me the error? [SEP] Clemmie: nm - fixing it in the snippet [SEP] Juliana: None [SEP] Juliana: None [SEP] Clemmie: hmm, can\u2019t edit snippets. [SEP] Clemmie: add a `]` before `.append` [SEP] Clemmie: and also your return statment at the end [SEP] Juliana: So now when it runs it comes out to say 'None' [SEP] Juliana: when printed [SEP] Clemmie: did you add the return? [SEP] Juliana: yeah [SEP] Clemmie: show please [SEP] Juliana: oh wait [SEP] Juliana: So now it is duplicating the 6 in each team [SEP] Clemmie: you are right, I didn\u2019t think the whole thing through completely - one sec [SEP] Clemmie: Can you show the output [SEP] Jena: what is the best way to generate list like [[0, 30], [30, 60], [60, 90], [90, 120], [120, 150], [150, 180], [180, 210], [210, 240], [240, 270], [270, 300], [300, 330], [330, 360]] ? incremental of 30 ... in pyspark [SEP] Juliana: ` {'Panthers': ['Karl Saygan', 'Les Clay', 'Herschel Krustofski', 'Matt Gill', 'Joe Kavalier', 'Eva Gordon', 'Karl Saygan', 'Les Clay', 'Herschel Krustofski', 'Matt Gill', 'Joe Kavalier', 'Eva Gordon'], 'Bandits': ['Bill Bon', 'Suzane Greenberg', 'Joe Smith', 'Sammy Adams', 'Sal Dali', 'Ben Finkelstein', 'Bill Bon', 'Suzane Greenberg', 'Joe Smith', 'Sammy Adams', 'Sal Dali', 'Ben Finkelstein'], 'Warriors': ['Phillip Helm', 'Jill Tanner', 'Diego Soto', 'Chloe Alaska', 'Arnold Willis', 'Kimmy Stein', 'Phillip Helm', 'Jill Tanner', 'Diego Soto', 'Chloe Alaska', 'Arnold Willis', 'Kimmy Stein']} ` [SEP] Clemmie: oh, ok, so the teams are broken down correctly, just duplicated. [SEP] Juliana: right <@Clemmie> [SEP] Clemmie: Can you add a `print(len(sorted_players))` at the beginning of the method [SEP] Juliana: 18 [SEP] Clemmie: never mind - I see what is happening [SEP] Clemmie: I think [SEP] Clemmie: are you still calling `even_teams` twice in `main` (once naked, and once inside a `print` statement)? [SEP] Juliana: None [SEP] Juliana: hmmm [SEP] Clemmie: Yeah, so you need to be careful calling methods multiple times. dicts are mutable, and like I said earlier son\u2019t _have_ to be returned, so you are adding players to the rosters twice, once with each method call [SEP] Clemmie: you need to capture the return of the method call the first time in a var (`teams_with_player_rosters` can be reused) and print that [SEP] Clemmie: Still with me? [SEP] Juliana: nope haha im trying to figure it out [SEP] Clemmie: k [SEP] Clemmie: Understanding it, or getting it to work? [SEP] Juliana: both [SEP] Juliana: like what part are you looking at when saying that in the dunder main? [SEP] Clemmie: in snippet that you posted you call `even_teams()` in lines 97 and 100 [SEP] Clemmie: that causes the rosters to be populated twice [SEP] Clemmie: but you are appending to lists, so it basically just duplicates the roster [SEP] Clemmie: if instead you make line 97 do `teams_with_player_rosters = even_teams(teams_with_player_rosters, sorted_players)` then line 100 can be `print(teams_with_player_rosters)` and the duplication should go away [SEP] Juliana: I think you are not refering to the right line numbers so im posting the full app. so i need to change line 90 to that teams = and the line 91 i need to print <@Clemmie> [SEP] Clemmie: line numbers changed from what you posted before, but yes, 90 and 91 [SEP] Juliana: what about line 89? [SEP] Juliana: well it worked! [SEP] Clemmie: it is fine. You could do away with it by changing line 90 to `teams_with_player_rosters = even_teams(creating_teams_open_list()\n, sorted_players)1 if you wanted [SEP] Juliana: hang on one sec let me digest this and explain in english what is going on [SEP] Clemmie: Great [SEP] Clemmie: exactly - don\u2019t worry about the stuff in `main` just tell what `even_teams` is doing [SEP] Melynda: I don't know what pyspark is yet (Googling next), but you can do this in plain Python easily: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; [[x, x + 30] for x in range(0, 360, 30)]\n[[0, 30], [30, 60], [60, 90], [90, 120], [120, 150], [150, 180], [180, 210], [210, 240], [240, 270], [270, 300], [300, 330], [330, 360]]``` [SEP] Juliana: Ok so <@Clemmie>, line 62 is taking the ` sorted_players ` from a previous function and is parsing through that list of ` sorted_players ` with ` enumerate() ` after that it is then assigning those players with a for loop into teams with open lists from ` teams_with_player_rosters `.

[SEP] Jolanda: I read a post where a guy used ML to predict if a element is a nav or not, using a score [SEP] Ashley: Nav?

Your help will be appreciated :pray::skin-tone-5: [SEP] Hiroko: What have you tried so far? [SEP] Mana: @dd82  [SEP] Sasha: You're very close. Have a look at the placement of the `x += 1` statement. Right now it's inside the `if` block, so it only gets executed in the \"not prime\" case. [SEP] Mana: I tried changing the placement but for everything number I input it returns \u201cit\u2019s not prime\u201d [SEP] Sasha: Maybe try printing out `x` so you can see what it thinks the number is divisible by. [SEP] Mana: Sure [SEP] Rodrick: Sorry, by DM i meant doing <@Rodrick> [SEP] Mana: <@Sasha> still not getting it [SEP] Stacy: doesn't appear your if/else statements line up with each other either. [SEP] Hiroko: yep [SEP] Rodrick: yea [SEP] Hiroko: also, please paste text, not images [SEP] Rodrick: its hard to edit them [SEP] Sasha: He's using a `while-else` construct, I think. [SEP] Rodrick: Oh [SEP] Rodrick: I think if you change the while-else to an if else it would work [SEP] Hiroko: so, I think you have two problems [SEP] Rodrick: try that <@Mana> [SEP] Hiroko: with your if block, you have the break inside it [SEP] Rodrick: oh yea [SEP] Hiroko: move the `x += 1 line down and out of that if conditional [SEP] Hiroko: eg\n\n```if n % x == 0:\n    print(...)\nx += 1\n``` [SEP] Hiroko: the `break` inside your `if` check is breaking out of the while loop [SEP] Sasha: The `break` is appropriate here, though, since you don't want to keep checking once you've found a factor. [SEP] Rodrick: Did that help <@Mana> [SEP] Rodrick: my suggestion or anyones? [SEP] Hiroko: <@Sasha> not really, IMO.  because the break inside there will stop the loop at the first check if the not a prime hits [SEP] Hiroko: here, a while-else is not appropriate, I think [SEP] Hiroko: there should be two checks inside the loop [SEP] Sasha: Hmmm, I hate to disagree with you, <@Hiroko>, but I think you might be confused about the math. If you're prime-checking the number 20, you know it's not prime as soon as you see it's divisible by 2. [SEP] Hiroko: :facepalm: you\u2019re right [SEP] Rodrick: haha [SEP] Hiroko: I misread that to check what numbers from 0 to n are prime [SEP] Hiroko: not an individual number [SEP] Sasha: Ah, gotcha.

A positive value of `count` means that you found a divisor, so the number is composite. [SEP] Mana: But I tried it and it worked [SEP] Rodrick: \"the code doesn't work: don't know why\" [SEP] Rodrick: \"The code does work: don't know why\" [SEP] Mana: :thinking_face: [SEP] Sasha: Can you copy-paste some sample output? [SEP] Sasha: There may also be some differences in what you're running and what you posted here. For instance, the use of `x` versus `i`, the capitalized `If`, etc. So maybe the print logic was accidentally reversed.

The code you're posting cannot run correctly, so if you're getting correct results in your environment, I can only assume that there's some differences somewhere. Are you copy-pasting or retyping it here?

[SEP] Sasha: You've still got that capital `If`, so that won't run as posted. And if you fix that and run it with different inputs, it will say that 4 is prime and 5 is not prime. [SEP] Mana: ```n = int(input(\"enter number :\")\ncount = 0\nx = 2\n\nwhile x &lt;= n//2:\n     if (n%x) == 0:\n       count += 1\n       break\n     x += 1\n\nif count == 0 and n != 1:\n      print(n, \"is prime\")\n\nelse:\n      print(n, \" is not prime\")```\n      \n      \n     [SEP] Sasha: Great.

[SEP] Jonas: So your milage may vary [SEP] Jonas: counter-intuitively, `x.extend(iterable)` can be slower than `x.extend(list(iterable))` [SEP] Jonas: as with the second case the length of the extension is *known* beforehand, whereas with the first it can be any length. So python grows the list dynamically [SEP] Clemmie: well, the `list` call has a defined length [SEP] Jonas: which has added overhead [SEP] Clemmie: makes sense [SEP] Jonas: to me it doesn't, as you're allocating a list with an unknown length anyway [SEP] Jonas: `list(iterable)` still suffers from the issue, as it's grown dynamically [SEP] Jonas: so `x.extend(list(iterable))` is senseless. But it's faster, so :shrug: [SEP] Clemmie: ah, good point. I\u2019ll have to take a look at the implementation of `extend`.

[SEP] Clemmie: Oh, absolutely, just an interesting tidbit to bring out in a code review to annoy people [SEP] Clemmie: <@Nenita> it is the difference between `strptime` and `strftime`. The first takes a string and format and makes a date, the other takes a date and spits out the string in the format you asked. If you try your line with `strptime` it should work [SEP] Nenita: f :magic: -&gt; p and it works, but im having to cut the time out of the date and i thought strftime would do that. [SEP] Clemmie: Right, so you need a `strptime` to make it a date object of the format wanted, and then wrap that in a `strftime` to get out the string format you want [SEP] Clemmie: If you have some time :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: check out this talk Russel Keith-Magee gave at Djangocon <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y13thlpbri8>", "1339": "Melynda: `strftime` is \"format this date/time instance into a string\", but `strptime` is \"parse this date-like string\".

You want either `\\S` or a non-greedy `.+`. [SEP] Candra: So remove parentheses? [SEP] Sasha: Sorry, let me explain. The `(.+)` is going to match as many characters as possible, including spaces, and THEN will try to match the `\\b`, which would be at the end of the string. So you either want to use `(\\S+)`, which only matches non-space characters, or `(.+?)`, which matches as few unrestricted characters as possible before the next `\\b`. [SEP] Candra: Yep actually just read the docs and saw that. [SEP] Candra: So the ? basically says as soon as we hit \\b we stop [SEP] Candra: Yay it works!

[SEP] Kristine: You should be putting that line in .bash_profile in your user directory really.

[SEP] Jordon: much appreciated [SEP] Kristine: Yeah, .bashrc didn\u2019t work because on OSX, when you run <http://Terminal.app|Terminal.app>, it creates a login-shell in each new terminal window instead of a non-login shell like you would normally experience on Linux. .bashrc is for non-login shells, and .bash_profile is for login shells [SEP] Hiroko: does that also apply to iterm2? [SEP] Kristine: I believe so, yes. [SEP] Hiroko: gotcha. [SEP] Kristine: I use iterm2, but I haven\u2019t actually paid close enough attention.

[SEP] Jordon: i should start using it [SEP] Jordon: everyone at work uses it [SEP] Jordon: im on the default terminal [SEP] Kristine: One solution if you\u2019re really used to using .bashrc from working on linux so much is to add\n```if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n   source ~/.bashrc\nfi```\nto your .bash_profile [SEP] Kristine: that way you could even share a .bashrc file across multiple linux and mac machines, and not have to worry about it not functioning properly on the macs, or having to echo the changes across to your .bash_profile every time [SEP] Jordon: thanks for the tips!", "1373": "Clayton: My equality comparison operators notebook:\n<https://github.com/paulgureghian/Comparison_Operators_in_Python/blob/master/'is'_vs_'%3D%3D'.ipynb>", "1374": "Stacy: anyone familiar with <https://quicktype.io/> ?  seems like a cool tool but i'm left trying to figure out how exactly it is useful / how to use it.  i pasted a large json snippet into it and it output a bunch of code.  so is the purpose of that generated code to be able to parse that type of json as input?  i guess i'm looking for a basic example to wrap my head around it, or maybe i'm just not understanding its purpose. [SEP] Hiroko: I\u2019m not sure how it would be useful? [SEP] Hiroko: requires you to write the json definition first, where you could be spending that time writing the code itself [SEP] Stacy: yeah so i just provided it json output from an API, so i'm not sure if the code being generated is to ultimately be able to parse/use the json output more efficiently moving forward or something, if you were to save the json output to a file, read it in using python then leveraging the python generated code or something.  no idea.

Also `filter()` returns a ``QuerySet` and `get()` returns a model instance. A `QuerySet` is an iterable, so you need to iterate through it to check ids of individual instances [SEP] Florencio: yeah [SEP] Florencio: i iterate through message and output the items [SEP] Florencio: Now just discovered I need to differentiate the ones worked on and the ones not worked on [SEP] Clemmie: So please show that code [SEP] Florencio: ```\ndef accepted_list(request):\n    msg_list = Message.objects.filter(status=\"Accepted\")\n    \n    pd = {\n        'list': msg_list\n    }\n    return render(request, 'manageportal/accepted_list.html', pd)\n``` [SEP] Clemmie: and please use the snippet feature found with the `+` next to the comment box - it adds line numbers to the code so we can talk more directly [SEP] Clemmie: Ok, so you got rid of the logic. Are you having an issue now? [SEP] Florencio: no issue with this [SEP] Florencio: I just want to check if this particular `id` in `message` exist in `tansaction` [SEP] Florencio: that's why I used `get` for transaction cos the `id` is supposed to be once [SEP] Hiroko: what\u2019s the model relationship between `Message` and `Transaction`? [SEP] Florencio: transaction has a column 'message' that is a foreignkey [SEP] Hiroko: ```try:\n    transaction = Transaction.objects.get(message_id = id)\nexcept Transaction.DoesNotExist as e:\n   # do something with exception\n\n... do something with transaction model``` [SEP] Florencio: okay [SEP] Florencio: the `id` part i don't understand [SEP] Florencio: it throws exception [SEP] Clemmie: what exception? [SEP] Hiroko: <@Florencio> if you want help, providing details is pretty important [SEP] Hiroko: for example your query above, providing said exception info would be a key part in figuring the solution [SEP] Florencio: sorry [SEP] Florencio: `int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'builtin_function_or_method'` [SEP] Clemmie: You really need to show your code [SEP] Clemmie: the entire method [SEP] Clemmie: That error makes little sense in the context of what we have been discussing [SEP] Dawn: how to convert a python datetime object to another timezone with pendulum? in the pendulum documentation it shows how to convert a pendulum object but it's not clear how to convert something that's not a pendulum object [SEP] Clemmie: First set the datetime you have to a pendulum object, then follow the docs. <https://github.com/sdispater/pendulum/issues/29> [SEP] Dawn: ah like that. but i do need a datetime object because i'm sending it to an odbc [SEP] Dawn: that's becoming a mess.. [SEP] Florencio: okay [SEP] Florencio: I'll do that [SEP] Florencio: None [SEP] Hiroko: line 16 is the first time it shows up, hasn\u2019t been declared anywhere else [SEP] Dawn: any fast way to convert from pendulum back to datetime object? the only example i could find is\n```\nif isinstance(value, pendulum.Pendulum):\n            value = datetime.datetime(\n                value.year, value.month, value.day, value.hour, value.minute,\n                value.second, value.microsecond, value.tzinfo\n            )\n```\nthat's a real detour [SEP] Dawn: and even that doesn't work as wanted, i just want a naive datetime as output, without the timezone explicitly included [SEP] Dawn: to convert to another timezone? [SEP] Dawn: don't know any other way to do that [SEP] Dawn: the use case is:\ni have a datetime object with UTC timezone\ni want to convert it to CET timezone\noutput should still be a datetime object because a database is going to handle it [SEP] Clemmie: do you need pendulum for anything else? if not you should probably use the `pytz` package (python timezone) [SEP] Dawn: i use it in other places to set the current time, but can use both [SEP] Dawn: as long as it fixes my problems :upside_down_face: [SEP] Clemmie: it should, it is basically for editing timezone info on python datetime objects [SEP] Florencio: <@Hiroko> id is supposed to be msg_list.id [SEP] Florencio: but rn I don't even know what to think [SEP] Florencio: I should prolly take coffee [SEP] Clemmie: If you want to get the list of all transactions that have an `accepted` message you can do it with the one-liner `transactions = Transactions.objects.filter(message__status = \"Accepted\")` [SEP] Clemmie: It reads a little odd otherwise, because you are getting all the accepted Messages, but then setting tick based on at least one of those messages being in a transaction [SEP] Leonarda: I'm new to python development and I am looking to build some scripts to configure linux VMs. Something like a bootstrap script with options to install different components like apache or mysql depending on the server's purpose. This is mostly just a learning exercise. Any suggestions on places I can look to get me started? Specifically, are there packages that have usefull tools for common system administration tasks? Thanks! [SEP] Florencio: <@Clemmie> I only want to work with id [SEP] Clemmie: can you describe what you are trying to do in words - your code doesn\u2019t make a huge amount of sense to me [SEP] Clemmie: I understand what it is trying to do, but what it is trying to do is confusing [SEP] Florencio: okay i'll try [SEP] Florencio: i have lets say 4 different request for different products [SEP] Florencio: this method shows only the ones I accepted [SEP] Florencio: in the ones accepted, they're some I have attended to and others I'm yet to [SEP] Florencio: the ones I've attended to, their Ids are saved in `Transaction` table [SEP] Clemmie: I get that - but the code seems to care about returning the accepted messages, where it seems to me you want to return the list of transactions whose messages were accepted [SEP] Florencio: okay [SEP] Clemmie: am i correct? [SEP] Clemmie: or not [SEP] Florencio: but not all Accepted Messages are in Transaction [SEP] Florencio: That's why I just go with if it is Accepted and also have it's Id in Transaction [SEP] Clemmie: Do you need all accepted messages, or only accepted messages that are also in a transaction? [SEP] Clemmie: Or all accepted messages, and whether they are in a transaction or not [SEP] Florencio: yeah all Accepted messages that are in Transaction  will have `tick = \"ok\"` [SEP] Florencio: else `tick = \"\"` [SEP] Clemmie: so all accepted messages, with tick ok for those in a transaction [SEP] Florencio: yeah [SEP] Florencio: that's it [SEP] Clemmie: Ok, so now put that into code. In particular you are not iterating through the message list to check if each message is in a transaction (and you will need to use `filter()` in the lookup, not `get()` as by you model a message can be in more than one transaction. You will probably also want to put them into a dict like `{'ok':[&lt;list of messages&gt;'], 'not':[&lt;list_of_messages&gt;]}` [SEP] Florencio: wow [SEP] Florencio: i'll try to understand what you mean [SEP] Florencio: i think i'll just leave this [SEP] Florencio: cos in my head it should be simple, but when i try to implement it, it's something else [SEP] Florencio: I'll make the field unique so that I dont have the same request twice in `Transaction` [SEP] Clemmie: You can also make it a OneToOne - it sounds like that is somewhat more correct for your use case [SEP] Florencio: but it's Foreignkey [SEP] Clemmie: Is this a production system? [SEP] Florencio: yep [SEP] Clemmie: oh, ok [SEP] Florencio: that's why I wanted to differentiate them by `ticks` [SEP] Florencio: so that I know while going through the list of all `Accepted` requests, I could see the ones with the `ticks` [SEP] Maricruz: I would do a boolean as True/False rather than \"ok\", \"\" [SEP] Maricruz: just a small thing [SEP] Sharika: Im trying to login into powerbi from my portal, get the tokens and thru that avoid the extra login step in powerbi embedded reports.

Its moreso the confusion around the `break` statement inside switch statements.  Switch statements have a \"feature\" where they passthrough to the next statement unless you use break. There are very few scenarios where this is actually needed, and it mostly is confusing to begginers and a lot of people don't understand that feature. So python, which is supposed to be easier to parse for begginers, just doesn't support it. Forces you to write your code in a way thats easier to understand [SEP] Clemmie: Do you have a citation for that? I\u2019m not saying you are wrong, but the reasonings I can find - In the docs: do it with `if elif else` \u201cThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\u201d and in the pep noted in the docs - 275 there is a throwaway line that speaks to the issue with dynamic typing `Note that the constants need not be all of the same type, but they should be comparable to the type of the switch variable.` [SEP] Clemmie: I also don\u2019t know about \u201ceasier to parse for beginners\u201d there are plenty of operators and reserved words in the standard lib that are barely comprehensible by experts. I mean `:=` was accepted for 3.8 [SEP] Mora: GDScript, which is a Python-esque language for Godot Engine, chose to use \u201cmatch\u201d: `<https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#match>`\nFollowing from the thought that `break` is often forgotten, `match` assumes each case breaks unless an explicit `continue` is encountered.

[SEP] Clemmie: <@Dawn> a couple of answers - the latter might be ever so slightly more performant, as you are accessing `properties` only once. In this use case it is minimal, but with larger or deeper data it could impact you.  I would also be wary about missing keys - it can be handled in both of these cases, but they lend themselves to being handled differently - in the first case to `shirt.get('properties', {}).get('color',None)` the second more to wrapping the properties in a `try....except KeyError` and then not bothering to look up color and size, just setting them to None. [SEP] Dawn: Thanks. Yeah i'm using this for ETL so i'll go for the more performant one. Using the replacement empty dict and None for the end value should be enough right?

[SEP] Melynda: &gt; Providing a sequence of arguments is generally preferred, as it allows the module to take care of any required escaping and quoting of arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file names).

I have a list that contains data like this:\n\n```\n[{'broker': 0, 'leader': True, 'in_sync': True}, {'broker': 1, 'leader': False, 'in_sync': True}]\n[{'broker': 1, 'leader': True, 'in_sync': True}, {'broker': 2, 'leader': False, 'in_sync': True}]\n[{'broker': 2, 'leader': True, 'in_sync': True}, {'broker': 0, 'leader': False, 'in_sync': True}]\n```\nThat data above is generated by this:  `broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]`\n\nMy output code is like so:\n\n```\nlc_partitions = [ p['partition'] for p in output['partitions'] ]\nlc_leader = [ l['leader'] for l in output['partitions'] ]\nlc_replicas = [ r['replicas'] for r in output['partitions'] ]\n\nfor i in range(slice):\n    print(i)\n    broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]\n    leader = [ x[i]['leader'] for x in lc_replicas ]\n    in_sync = [ x[i]['in_sync'] for x in lc_replicas ]\n\n    for lc_p,lc_l,b,l,i in zip(lc_partitions, lc_leader, broker, leader, in_sync):\n        print('Partitions: Partition - {0} Leader - {1} Replicas: Broker - {2} Leader - {3} In_Sync - {4}'.format(lc_p, lc_l, b, l, i))\n```\n\nThe issue is that it prints the formatted data for each loop, when I only want to print part of the output once, and concatenate/zip/? the replica data (which requires the looping, at least how I'm doing it currently) to each Partitions line.  So it currently does this:\n\n```\n0 #loop count\nPartitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - True In_Sync - True\nPartitions: Partition - 1 Leader - 1 Replicas: Broker - 1 Leader - True In_Sync - True\nPartitions: Partition - 2 Leader - 2 Replicas: Broker - 2 Leader - True In_Sync - True\n```\n\n```\n1 #loop\nPartitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 1 Leader - False In_Sync - True\nPartitions: Partition - 1 Leader - 1 Replicas: Broker - 2 Leader - False In_Sync - True\nPartitions: Partition - 2 Leader - 2 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - False In_Sync - True\n```\n\nI want the lines to look like this:\n\n`Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 1 Leader - False In_Sync - True`\n`Partitions: Partition - 1 Leader - 1 Replicas: Broker - 1 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 2 Leader - False In_Sync - True`\n`Partitions: Partition - 2 Leader - 2 Replicas: Broker - 2 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 0 Leader - False In_Sync - True`\n\nHopefully this makes sense. [SEP] Stacy: <@Sasha> so the lines that i want it to look like combine sections of both loop 0 and loop1 because `lc_replicas` contains two dictionaries within one list, so I have to loop through those keys with these:\n\n```\n    broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]\n    leader = [ x[i]['leader'] for x in lc_replicas ]\n    in_sync = [ x[i]['in_sync'] for x in lc_replicas ]\n```\nI'm doing this because I believe these show the results of partitions that have 2 replicas - it could be 1 to 3 so I'm trying to take that into account, in which case the line i want it to look like could potentially be  `Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 1 Leader - False In_Sync - True, ****Broker - 2, Leader - False, In_Sync - True****` where the third loop adds the content contained within asterisks.  Does that help?  Without the loops the output would simply be `Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0` which requires no loops, just a matter of zipping the results together so they match up. [SEP] Stacy: I basically want to concat the content from the loops of the dictionaries together so they're contained on the same line when I zip everything together. [SEP] Sasha: From your original list: [SEP] Stacy: i'm not sure if leveraging itertools / chain would help in this case.  haven't used it before. [SEP] Stacy: so there's a total of 47 partitions total (contained within `lc_partitions = [ p['partition'] for p in output['partitions'] ]` - i only need to loop those once.  the way the current code works is it adds the replicas details to the partitions in two separate loops because i'm looping broker/leader/in_sync list comprehensions twice in this example....it could potentially be 1-3.  so in the snippets where it shows `#loop 0`, it goes from 0 to 47, with the first slice/element of dictionaries in the list :\n\n```\n    broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]\n    leader = [ x[i]['leader'] for x in lc_replicas ]\n    in_sync = [ x[i]['in_sync'] for x in lc_replicas ]\n```\n\nloop 1 then goes through partitions 0-47 again, appending the second element of the list. i want both `x[0]['broker'],x[0]['leader'],x[0]['in_sync'] and x[1]['broker'],x[1]['leader'],x[1]['in_sync']` printed on the same line. [SEP] Sasha: Let me sketch out what I think you want, and you correct me... Give me a sec. [SEP] Stacy: i'm probably complicating by just doing snippets vs the whole thing, i can try to provide more if that would help [SEP] Sasha: I think you just want a nested loop like this, if I understand which data you want where. [SEP] Sasha: Doesn't do the commas correctly, but meh, you get the idea. [SEP] Stacy: Yes!!!!! [SEP] Stacy: Ok, so this strips out the need of me needing to my slice logic to take into account how many dictionaries there might be in the replicas because well....it's already provided.  That's apparent now [SEP] Stacy: i knew at some point i'd have to end with a space in attempt to concat the two lines together also.  i had this commented out from previous troubleshooting `#print(lc_p, lc_l, l, b, i, end=' ')` [SEP] Stacy: my confusion was how to iterate those dictionaries within the replicas list. [SEP] Stacy: this is great.  thank you <@Sasha> at some point i'm going to have to buy you beers instead of tacos (if you're in to that.)  :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Sasha: Heh, no problem. Happy to help, and glad it wasn't as complicated as it seemed. [SEP] Stacy: still getting a hang of python data structures.  i always seem to over complicate it and have to strip things down.. need to quit making things so hard. [SEP] Stacy: can't wait till rhel8 when i can start using f-strings all the time.  using .format to be compatible on my servers for now. [SEP] Sasha: Sure, go for it. [SEP] Demetrice: So i'm trying to help a friend with a coding challenge. and i realized that i can't quite conceptualize it myself [SEP] Demetrice: None [SEP] Demetrice: So i first i thought it would just be a series of if statements and that would be simple enough. But then i realized it will probably incorporate some concepts i'm not familiar with [SEP] Demetrice: I mean i don't actually have to write it. Just conceptualizing it successfully is the goal. [SEP] Demetrice: If it's too long to read i can do a tl;dr [SEP] Sasha: I understand the problem, but it's not immediately obvious how to solve it. My first point of slight confusion is even to figure out what the brackets look like for tournaments that don't have a power-of-two number of teams, since some teams will have to skip a round, and maybe we want our favored team to do that. [SEP] Demetrice: I thought the implication was that there's any number of teams [SEP] Demetrice: but i don't think odd numbers are allowed. I think it has to be a logical bracket [SEP] Sasha: For our team to advance to a slot in the bracket, it will have to be the highest-ranked team in that subtree, but the exact ordering of other teams doesn't matter within that tree. [SEP] Demetrice: I mean that's an assumption, but i don't know how that wouldn't be the case [SEP] Demetrice: Ohh you're right [SEP] Demetrice: You know i've been trying to make the bracket from the bottom up [SEP] Demetrice: But i think just &gt; statements might work? [SEP] Demetrice: I'm not sure [SEP] Demetrice: No it's not that easy. Hmm [SEP] Sasha: Waaaait... in the pasted text, it says \"2N\" teams. Is that actually \"2^N\" with an exponent? [SEP] Demetrice: So i was thinking and i'm not sure if this makes sense but i was thinking we'd want to try to sort it top to bottom x number of times [SEP] Demetrice: Yeah it pastes 2N but it's actually 2^N [SEP] Sasha: Okay, that's much easier, so we have a complete tree, with no skipped rounds. [SEP] Demetrice: I can't tell if it's easy or hard. Would we want to try to sort it? How would you approach this? [SEP] Sasha: We know that if our team is the lowest ranked, it wins 0 rounds. If there is at least 1 lower-ranked team, it wins 1 round. If there are 3 lower-ranked teams, it can win 2 rounds. If there are 7 lower-ranked teams, it can win 3 rounds, etc. [SEP] Demetrice: Okay, i didn't think of it in that way [SEP] Sasha: So all you have to do is put our team in the first slot, put all the lower-ranked teams in the next slots, and then fill the rest with the higher-ranked teams. [SEP] Demetrice: Huh [SEP] Demetrice: Yeah i mean that makes sense conceptually [SEP] Demetrice: Wait no that actually makes sense [SEP] Demetrice: So you just arrange the teams in order of weakest to strongest [SEP] Demetrice: Place are team in the first slot and then fill out the bracket? [SEP] Demetrice: *** our [SEP] Sasha: Yep, that seems to be a sufficient solution. The code would basically just be a print loop with an if or two. [SEP] Demetrice: So we're just ordering the teams from weakest to strongest. bumping ours to the front slot and then printing the result? [SEP] Demetrice: That's it? [SEP] Sasha: Pretty much, yep. Unless someone sees something we're missing about the problem. [SEP] Demetrice: My friend asks what if we wanted to make the bracket random [SEP] Demetrice: Which isn't actually a requirement but would probably make it significantly harder [SEP] Sasha: I don't quite understand. If it's random, we don't have any choice. [SEP] Demetrice: Well maybe not random [SEP] Demetrice: But not as ordered as our team, weakest -&gt; strongest [SEP] Demetrice: Not random i guess just disorganized. to mimic an actual bracket [SEP] Sasha: You can definitely scramble up the teams and still get the same result, as long as there are at least 2^m - 1 weaker teams in our team's tree (for winning m rounds). [SEP] Demetrice: Okay, i think i understand the simple solution pretty well conceptually [SEP] Demetrice: But i wouldn't know how to conceptualize how to solve a the problem to get the scrambled version [SEP] Demetrice: That would be significantly harder, right? [SEP] Sasha: Not necessarily. Step 1 would be to figure out how many rounds your team is supposed to win. Then you can fill out his nearby bracket with any random choice of 2^m - 1 out of the weaker teams. And then fill the rest of the brackets randomly from whoever is left, stronger or weaker. [SEP] Demetrice: I think i'm almost there. I'm just struggling conceptualizing it because it scales so hard [SEP] Demetrice: if there's 100 rounds and we're supposed to win 40 [SEP] Demetrice: Then that would be err a lot of local brackets to fill out [SEP] Demetrice: Maybe there's a simple way to account for that that i'm not thinking of [SEP] Sasha: Well, there's no way around that if you have 100 rounds... that's 2^100, or about 10^30, a really astronomical-sized tournament. [SEP] Demetrice: lol somehow a tournament with more team's that humans on the planet [SEP] Demetrice: Maybe it's a universal tournament [SEP] Demetrice: Okay so maybe not 100 but say there's 10 [SEP] Demetrice: and we're supposed to win 8 [SEP] Sasha: \"Pick the best atom on the planet!\" [SEP] Demetrice: lol [SEP] Demetrice: That's 64 \"local\" Teams to assign [SEP] Demetrice: as opposed to another example when there's only 2 if we're only winning one game [SEP] Demetrice: How do i account for that level of variance. The more i think about it the more i think there's probably a pretty easy way to write it. [SEP] Sasha: Yep. The more rounds you want to \"fix\", the more control you have to have over the brackets. But the problem as stated has you printing out all the brackets anyway, so it's the same amount of work either way, more or less. [SEP] Demetrice: So when i know how many rounds our team should be winning just need put that many teams in the first x spaces and then randomize it? I suppose [SEP] Demetrice: So if we're winning 3 rounds i'm only concerning myself with the first 8 entries and so on and so forth [SEP] Demetrice: There's a lot of this that i can't write but i think i understand it for the most part now [SEP] Sasha: Yep [SEP] Demetrice: :taco: <@Sasha> Make that a mega Taco [SEP] Sasha: And if there are, say, 12 lower-ranked teams, you can pick any 7 of them. [SEP] Demetrice: I don't know why you never sleep, but i'm not complaining about it [SEP] Sasha: Heh, I do, but I'm a couple of time-zones westward, so it's not as late here. [SEP] Demetrice: At least the simple version anyway", "1463": "Demetrice: Oh hey <@Sasha> I'm trying to understand a problem conceptually, could we talk through it?", "1464": "Demetrice: You know i think i'm going to try to write it. I'm curious [SEP] Demetrice: So how does this look so far [SEP] Demetrice: None [SEP] Demetrice: <@Sasha> I'm not sure if you're still around. But i think i just need help on the last step [SEP] Sasha: Cool, I like the remove-and-append, very elegant. For the last step you just need to print them out in pairs. One easy way to do that would be to use `range()` with a step size of 2. [SEP] Demetrice: Trying to figure out how to print it in pairs has me stumped [SEP] Demetrice: Wait [SEP] Demetrice: It's a for statement and i'm leveraging the range function taking 3 parameters. But i can't put it all together in my head [SEP] Sasha: I'll give you a hint. You want to print out Teams[0]-Teams[1], then Teams[2]-Teams[3], etc. So if the range is giving you 0, 2, 4, etc... [SEP] Maegan: <@Demetrice> this should help you out, in a loop mention the start and end bound and you should have multiple lists that can be `join()`ed with a `-`\n\n<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6632188/explicitly-select-items-from-a-python-list-or-tuple> [SEP] Demetrice: I tried This. Which was wrong. I'm sure this is simple but it's 2:30 am. Just give me a sec [SEP] Maegan: seems  it is your homework? [SEP] Demetrice: No it's not homework. I was initially just doing research for a friend. But now i just want to complete it for pride [SEP] Demetrice: My brain hurts. This shouldn't be so difficult [SEP] Russ: Given that `l = [%your_list_from_#random_channel%]` this would print elements in pairs:\n```\nfor elem in range(1, len(l), 2):\n    print(f'{elem}-{l[l.index(elem) + 1]}')\n```\nNote that you need to sort the list first, otherwise you'll have `7-9` and then `9-10` [SEP] Russ: But I feel that's some kind of hack and it will break easily... [SEP] Sasha: Yeah, there's some back-story to the list indicating why you don't want to sort it. [SEP] Demetrice: I don't know if i'm missing something obvious or if this is legitimately hard. But it i just applied and if statement and used the range properly this would be done [SEP] Sasha: Here's another hint... if you wanted to print out \"10-11, 20-21, 30-31\" and I gave you 10, 20, 30 from the range() function, how would you attack that? [SEP] Russ: How about this?\n```\nfor idx, elem in enumerate(l):\n    if idx % 2 == 0:\n        print(f'{elem}-{l[idx+1]}')\n``` [SEP] Sasha: That would work, <@Russ> [SEP] Demetrice: for i in range (1,NumTeams,2):\n        print (i, i+1) [SEP] Demetrice: I think i'm getting further away from a right answer [SEP] Sasha: Nope, you're super close. Now how do you get from `i` to the `i`th team in your list? [SEP] Demetrice: I tried replacing the , with :  and - neither worked [SEP] Demetrice: I should probably just sleep on it [SEP] Sasha: Probably wise. I expect it'll just make complete sense with a fresh look tomorrow.", "1465": "Berenice: I am not sure if this belongs here, if somebody wants to get started with hacking/reverse-engineering in python what book/reading would you would you suggest?

It creates a generator that will yield (in this case) a list object containing discovered factors of the value you pass to the function (stored in `n`).

[SEP] Lawrence: I'm able to print it out just fine - it looks correctly formatted [SEP] Hiroko: ```127.0.0.1:5000/Hi``` suggests this is a route [SEP] Carmen: POST does not put the parameters in the URL. [SEP] Lawrence: <@Hiroko> Hi is the `&lt;call&gt;` variable in this case [SEP] Lawrence: <@Carmen> I believe you are right but I can't determine the proper route format [SEP] Carmen: So when you're using `ENDPOINT = <http://127.0.0.1:5000>`, you're making a call to that specific URL with POST data. You need to either modify `ENDPOINT` to have the `call` URL parameter, or adjust your route in Flask to not require it and instead to pull that data from the request POST data. [SEP] Lawrence: ah I see [SEP] Carmen: Which you do depends on whether `call` is something that you were specifying in your payload or not. [SEP] Lawrence: so `ENDPOINT = ...:5000/?call=`?

Almost every HTTP request framework is going to not append the POST data to the URL. It's going to pass it as actual POST data in the request body.

[SEP] Janis: Those are pushButtons not checkboxes [SEP] Nenita: i use that, not to tell which button was pressed, but because of what stringvar it is i can tell which button was pressed [SEP] Nenita: yea i know, i just was pointing out i use stringvar with checkbuttons [SEP] Janis: Well i am using same text name for every button as they will be performing same operation [SEP] Nenita: would you mind posting some code?

[SEP] Rodrick: Correct [SEP] Carmen: Can the string be repeated in the file? If so, do you need just the first line, or all lines?

Keep track of the line you're on through an integer you increment each loop. When you find a match, print the line integer and break out of the loop (if you only need to find the first match).\" [SEP] Rodrick: Ok, but is there a piece of code thats is like `linethestringison = readlineget(\"joe is cool\")` [SEP] Sasha: For something like this, `for i, line in enumerate(myfile)` would work well. Match against the data in `line`, and `i` will be the corresponding line number. [SEP] Rodrick: ok [SEP] Rodrick: What does `enumerate` do? [SEP] Sasha: It takes a list/iterator/whatever and gives you both the item number and the item as a tuple. So `enumerate(\"foo\")` would give you `(0, \"f\"), (1, \"o\"), (2, \"o\")`. [SEP] Sasha: Very handy when you want to keep track of a list index as well as access the data conveniently. [SEP] Carmen: You will need to define a function `readlineget` that takes your search string, does the searching process, and returns the line number. Python doesn't have a built-in function to do that. [SEP] Carmen: <@Sasha> Purely for my curiosity (and to avoid having to dig into the docs) do you know if enumerating a file object like that reads the entire file into a list, or if it uses a generator to do it lazily? [SEP] Sasha: It should be lazy, give or take some amount of buffering in the file I/O. [SEP] Carmen: About what I expected. Groovy. [SEP] Carmen: `enumerate` isn't in my normal toolkit, so I'm not familiar with its semantics. [SEP] Sasha: It's rarely required to solve a problem, but it'll often save you a line or two by eliminating manually incremented counter variables, etc. [SEP] Carmen: Which is primarily what I'm thinking of, since I use those all the fecking time in my scripts.

I have built out a very small portion of the backend but I guess I would need more of a rough estimate before it is fully built. [SEP] Carmen: Some questions to help you wrap your head around what you need:\n\u2022 How much raw processing is needed for what the app is doing? Is it crunching a lot of numbers per request? More processing means you need more processors.\n\u2022 How many users will you need to support concurrently? More concurrent users = more connections at a time = more processors and more RAM.\n\u2022 How large are your data structures and responses? If you have to load 500MB of data into memory for each request to do the processing, your RAM requirements are much higher than if you're doing iterative file processing line by line.\n\u2022 Do you need to be storing data? User uploads, generated files being downloaded by users, etc. More of those means more disk space needed. [SEP] Carmen: One thing that will absolutely help you out is to run some benchmarks on your existing code. Use a testing tool like Apache JMeter to simulate load on your app and see how it performs.

You only need the `global` if you are *reassigning* the variable. If you are, say, appending an item to a global list, it's still the same list object, so it's not necessary, even though the contents are being modified.

[SEP] Chuck: Or, perhaps, a convention for doing that that has nothing to with naming? [SEP] Carmen: Normally if I have to do something like that and it doesn't make sense to put it in a branch for development, I have 3 functions: the public function everything else uses, and then two internal functions that the public function calls based on its own logic. One internal function is the old function, and the other is the new function. [SEP] Chuck: Hmmm, how often would you branch for a single function rewrite? I guess that depends on the coder [SEP] Chuck: <@Carmen> I like that approach [SEP] Carmen: Normally you'd use a configuration switch to dictate which internal function gets executed. [SEP] Carmen: That also lets you A/B test for specific users. [SEP] Carmen: That said, if you're making significant changes, often you really should be doing it on a separate branch so that you can make the switch wholesale. [SEP] Chuck: I do need to wrap my brain around creating branches in Git, and absorbing the changes back into my main code base -- even though I'm the only dev and the only user of the code, it would be useful to understand [SEP] Carmen: `git checkout &lt;branch name&gt;`\n`git commit`\n`git checkout master`\n`git merge &lt;branch name&gt;` [SEP] Carmen: Branches are even easier to create in Git than they are in other source control systems. [SEP] Chuck: So... let's say I have a (windows 7) directory called \"MyProject\" in which my current code resides... How do I work on a branch while also being able to execute the non-branch version of the code? [SEP] Sasha: If you want them both to be simultaneously accessible, you'd want to checkout a second copy of your git repo in a different directory. [SEP] Chuck: Okay, so I could have \"MyProject\" and \"MyProject_Branch\". I leave \"MyProject\" untouched, I work on the code in \"MyProject_Branch\", and when I'm ready, I merge the changes in \"MyProject_Branch\" back into \"MyProject\"... [SEP] Sasha: Well, this is only if you need to run them both side-by-side. Any git repo can be on any branch, and can change branches easily. [SEP] Sasha: So people typically will just switch back and forth in their main git directory as needed. [SEP] Chuck: how do I change between the master and the branch in the same directory? [SEP] Chuck: (unless I misunderstood what you meant by this: `So people typically will just switch back and forth in their main git directory as needed.`) [SEP] Sasha: The `git checkout [branch]` command that <@Carmen> referenced changes it. [SEP] Chuck: okay, here goes [SEP] Sasha: Hang on. Don't ever say \"okay, here goes\" with git. Look up the docs and understand the command, please... [SEP] Chuck: lol, good advice :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Sasha: There's a separate way to create branches, for instance. [SEP] Chuck: I never do anything destructive that I can't walk away from :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Chuck: well... never intentionally... I learned that a few mistakes ago. :wink: [SEP] Sasha: Obligatory: <https://ohshitgit.com/> [SEP] Chuck: <@Sasha> and <@Carmen> -- thanks both, this was a very useful conversation to me :taco: [SEP] Chuck: Do either of you use PyCharm? [SEP] Chuck: Just wondering if there is any way in PyCharm to see at a glance which 'branch' you currently have activated [SEP] Chuck: ah... bottom right [SEP] Chuck: okay, so that went okay... i created a branch, and merged it back into the master -- although I wish it had been a little more guided than throwing conflict text into the source code. [SEP] Chuck: I think the only real 'downside' I could see was that the branch changes have to be committed before you can go back to the master, and vice versa -- although this does make sense [SEP] Sasha: There's `git stash` if you want to save uncommitted changes temporarily. [SEP] Chuck: it looks like PyCharm can do that as well [SEP] Chuck: is it normal on a merge that you get all the conflicted code in  the source code and then you manually go remove / resolve the conflicts by editing the source? [SEP] Chuck: or did I do that part non-optimally? [SEP] Sasha: There are graphical tools which can make that friendlier, and if you know you want to keep one version or the other, you can force a \"mine or theirs\" merge, but yeah, generally the philosophy is that in case of conflict, you want to have human eyes on it. [SEP] Chuck: that must be a huge task if you're merging in a lot of changes across a complex project [SEP] Chuck: or if you're trying to resolve conflicts from a branch when the master has moved along significantly via other branch merges... [SEP] Sasha: Depends. Many changes in large codebases tend to merge without manual intervention, since people aren't editing the same lines simultaneously. [SEP] Chuck: Yep, that might have been my mistake... I think I commented out the change I had started on in the 'master' after I created the branch, so there were probably changes outstanding in both [SEP] Chuck: <@Sasha> Have another one of :taco: [SEP] Chuck: You're absolutely right -- I just tested creating a branch, and merging it back with a known committed master, and no conflicts, just brought the change in from the branch [SEP] Chuck: Last question, is it standard to remove branches that have been merged back into the master? or do you leave them there as a history? [SEP] Sasha: That's a good question, and I'm not quite sure, but I think common best practice would be to remove the branch if you don't plan any further work on it. A branch is basically just a label for a particular commit that shows up in a list of branches, so all the history is preserved either way, and you can recreate it later pointing to the same or a different commit if you want. [SEP] Sasha: The exception would be that some people use release branches, so it's useful to keep the \"v1.2\" release tagged in the repo indefinitely.

[SEP] Erline: I wish I could figure out how to be more specific [SEP] Erline: I see that Apache has error logs and access logs. The access logs don\u2019t say all that much. Are there other places to look for logs that should be considered? [SEP] Sasha: It depends what you're running. Are you just using Apache with static pages, or is it a frontend for a Django / Flask / PHP / something dynamic site? [SEP] Erline: I hope I can answer your question. I think my local machine was already running it.  [SEP] Erline: I say that because before the 400 I had seen the \u201cit works\u201d generic message you\u2019d normally see from Apache.  [SEP] Erline: I\u2019m not trying to run Django or anything at the moment, though I was originally trying to.  [SEP] Sasha: Okay, it sounds like it's just a bare Apache instance with no custom site or other stuff. [SEP] Erline: Pretty sure yeah.  [SEP] Sasha: Can you explain what you were trying to do with vagrant? [SEP] Erline: Yeah, I can. I was trying to simulate a Django/wagtail production environment. I installed nginx and uwsgi. I changed the vagrant file to have port forwarding on :8000 for guest and also for host. Then once I got nginx and uwsgi up and running, I was trying to figure out how to view the Django app and if I needed to change port forwarding in my vagrantfile.  [SEP] Sasha: Great! Now we have a little more information to go on. I have no idea how to solve your problem myself, but hopefully someone with more experience in this sort of thing will.  :fingers_crossed: [SEP] Erline: Alright, thank you! [SEP] Erline: I never know how much info to give before someone gets confused.  [SEP] Sasha: A good rule of thumb to kick things off is \"what you wanted to accomplish, what you tried, and what problem you encountered\". That'll usually give people enough context to give some useful feedback or at least ask intelligent followup questions.

Then you will do \npip install -r requirements.txt [SEP] Erline: make sure you\u2019re in the same directory as the requirements.txt file for what I wrote above to work.  [SEP] Erline: Oh I think I understand the prior question you had about why the virtual env folder exists in the first place. It stores all of the related libraries for your project. Instead of you installing everything directly to your machine, you have a little place to store the specific things you need for that specific project.  [SEP] Erline: Venv mode is to ensure you know that you are in a virtual environment, and if you ultimately name your virtual environments different names, you know which one you\u2019re in.  [SEP] Erline: You wouldn\u2019t want everything installed directly on to your machine because different projects may need different versions of things.

For local network comms, the machines should be able to access each other through the switch. However, your router is probably giving everyone dynamic network addresses, which may or may not be constant over time. You might need to configure the router to give a predictable address to the machine acting as the MySQL server so that the other machines know how to find it. For the mean time, you can get things tested using whatever address is happens to have, though. [SEP] Carmen: I do not have direct experience with it. I've just done a decent bit of research on it in the past. [SEP] Carmen: So if I were you I'd set up one of the existing SSO identity providers, whichever one is easiest and least expensive for you to setup, and then integrate the other systems with it. [SEP] Carmen: Which protocol you decide on for those other integrations once again boils down to which library is most convenient for you to work with. [SEP] Carmen: It seems like there might be a bit of terminology confusion here. \"Server\" has two separate meanings in this context. You have the database server software, MySQL Server. That's what is listening on your network and what your clients connect to. You also have the database server hardware, which is whatever machine is connected to the network and running MySQL Server. [SEP] Carmen: Any computer can be a server, but typically for something like that you want a dedicated server, which is just a machine that's always on and isn't running other things (e.g. being used as a desktop for the secretary or another developer). [SEP] Donnell: <@Carmen> Yes little bit confusion with terminology. So for our project, we need to have centralized database. But in conversation with our project manager, he was saying we need to have a computer working as Server and should have database. So maybe he is saying a dedicated server for this? [SEP] Donnell: So XAMP would help me make the computer as dedicated server ? [SEP] Carmen: Whether something is a server or not is entirely dependent on what you do with it and whether it's dedicated to that task. If you install MySQL on it, and it's dedicated to providing those database services to other apps, it's now your dedicated database server. [SEP] Donnell: Oh ok.

Also note that I have some lines with Time and PCd, i dont need those, I only need the lines where only Time and Cd are there, and store the value next to Time in a cell, store the value next to Cd in the next column, and the next instance of the same pattern should save it in the next row.\n\"TIME= 0 DIR= 1 DRAG -276.988985689\nTIME= 0 Cd 0.267186748343\nTIME= 0 PCd 0.246429012997\"\nNot sure if my explanation is clear enough, anyways, how should I proceed with this task? Any ideas would be immensely helpful. Thank you [SEP] Sasha: The general strategy you'll want to have is to process the lines one by one with a loop like `for line in myfile`. You'll want to use the `re` module for a regex to recognize the lines you want and to pull out the values from them.

You'd want one of these when you want to modify something in-place (or you just want read-only access to it, no modifications needed). You want a deep copy of something when you need to modify the new copy, but retain the old copy as it was at the time of the copy (or do something else to modify it that won't affect the new copy). [SEP] Carmen: Shallow copies are great for when you've got a gigantic object in memory, and you don't want to make copies of it for no good reason.

I noticed that Python has embedded distributions that are downloadable as a zip, and contain an exe, but I'm surprised they don't just have it ready to go for a Mac as well, unless I'm missing something? [SEP] Carmen: That's because Mac is Linux-based, so AFAIK typically they have a system Python included already. [SEP] Carmen: For values of linux-based anyway. [SEP] Carmen: Are you planning to do it by the installer on final install, or do you want to modify the zip file during your build process?

[SEP] Monica: didn't know that! [SEP] Carmen: Realistically, I'd assume the modules should mostly already be pre-compiled. If not, yeah, you'll want to compile them down to bytecode.

I'll have to share a bunch of code so didn't wanna flood the chat [SEP] Frankie: I think it's just bad the way I've designed it so I'm trying to rearrange things a bit [SEP] Frankie: basically the problem is I have an API which I built as a project app, which supplies all the data for my site and it uses DRF. However, I also have a blog app, which uses wagtail, which also uses DRF. So I had to do some custom permissions magic cause Wagtail was trying to send its API requests through my personal API's custom permissions classes, and now I've got a permissions module in my API app which I need in my `settings.py`, but the permissions module requires some things out of `settings.py` to determine the permissions. Lol [SEP] Frankie: Here is some relevant info if it helps.\n\nMy API's *custom_permissions.py:*\n```\nfrom rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission\nfrom rest_framework.exceptions import MethodNotAllowed\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\nCURRENT_FREE_TICKERS = settings.CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS\nCURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS = settings.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS\nCURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS = settings.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS\nCURRENT_VALID_REFERERS = settings.CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS\n\nclass IsPremium(BasePermission):\n    \"\"\"\n    API restriction to premium users only.\n    \"\"\"\n    def has_permission(self, request, view):\n        # Do stuff w/ variables from above to determine permissions\n```\n\n*settings/base.py:*\n```\nimport os, sys\n\n# For local dev\nif os.environ.get('DJANGO_ENV') == 'DEV':\n    from . import env_dev as env\nelse:\n    from . import env\n\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))\nPROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))\nsys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, 'apps'))\n\n# Env settings\nSECRET_KEY = env.SECRET_KEY\nDEBUG = env.DEBUG\n... other vars\nCURRENT_FREE_TICKERS = env.CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS\nCURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS = env.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS\nCURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS = env.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS\nCURRENT_VALID_REFERERS = env.CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS\n\n# Custom permissions for personal API\nfrom lfa_lite.apps.api.permissions.custom_permissions import IsPremium\n\n# ... other settings\n\n# Default DRF stuff for Wagtail to segregate it from my API\nREST_FRAMEWORK = {\n    'DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES': (\n        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',\n    ),\n    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (\n        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',\n    )\n}\n\n# For my personal API. Checks both IsAuthenticated as well as custom stuff\nLFA_API_SETTINGS = {\n    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (\n        IsPremium,\n    )\n}\n```\n\nSnippet of my API's *views.py*:\n```\nfrom rest_framework.viewsets import ViewSet\nfrom rest_framework.decorators import action\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Get default perms from settings, so I can change it in only one place if needed, or add more perms\nLFA_DEFAULT_PERMS = settings.LFA_API_SETTINGS['DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES']\n\nclass SomeViewSet(ViewSet):\n    permission_classes = LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS\n\n    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)\n    def some_action(self, request, format=None):\n        # Do stuff\n\n    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)\n    def some_other_action(self, request, format=None):\n        # Do other stuff\n\nclass OtherViewSet(ViewSet):\n    permission_classes = LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS\n\n    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)\n    def some_different_action(self, request, format=None):\n        # Do different stuff\n\n    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)\n    def some_other_different_action(self, request, format=None):\n        # Do other different stuff\n\n# ... lots more ViewSets and APIViews\n```\n\nThe actual issue is that when I launch it into my staging environment on AWS (elastic beanstalk) the `SECRET_KEY` is coming back as empty, I think because the circular dependency is causing it to fail loading the settings. In staging, I use a staging.py settings file which basically is just `from base import *` and adds a few other variables for AWS and my live database and stuff. [SEP] Frankie: So it turns out if I remove the `IsPremium` import from base.py and the one setting that uses it, and instead import `IsPremium` directly into custom_permissions.py, the app deploys normally but fails data migrations. That's a different problem, but I'm still wondering if anyone can see a way to be able to control the default permissions class in settings.py instead of having to do it in the API views like this:\n\n```\nfrom .permissions.custom_permissions import IsPremium\nLFA_DEFAULT_PERMS = (IsPremium,)\n```\n\nIt would just be nice to have a single place to manage everything where the settings for DRF already live. :man-shrugging: [SEP] Frankie: that doesn't seem like python to me...", "1678": "Hai: None [SEP] Hai: what is the format of the output?

And translation.gettext() always uses the default language. Any ideas? [SEP] Reanna: I'm using the built-in i18n set_language route to toggle languages. [SEP] Hiroko: just checking, but are you following the location rules for setting the middleware? [SEP] Hiroko: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/i18n/translation/#how-django-discovers-language-preference> [SEP] Reanna: Yes, the middleware is included and in the correct location.

[SEP] Hiroko: gotcha [SEP] Hiroko: having `activate` not persist across requests is probably standard behavior [SEP] Hiroko: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/i18n/translation/#explicitly-setting-the-active-language> [SEP] Hiroko: &gt;&gt;&gt;You\u2019ve already been introduced to django.utils.translation.activate().

To persist the language for the entire session, also modify LANGUAGE_SESSION_KEY in the session: [SEP] Hiroko: &gt;&gt;&gt;You would typically want to use both: django.utils.translation.activate() will change the language for this thread, and modifying the session makes this preference persist in future requests. [SEP] Reanna: I see. So now this is quite strange... the session has the corrent language set, but gettext() always uses the default language - this is the bug I'm originally trying to solve.

[SEP] Hiroko: <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/utils/translation/trans_real.py#L284> [SEP] Hiroko: my guess is for whatever reason, `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE` is always used in your case. [SEP] Reanna: Yes.. i guess the i18n set_language route isn't setting the language correctly.

In C-like languages, declaring all variables at the top of the scope used to be required, then it held on as a style guide rule, and then finally fell out of favor a long time ago.

[SEP] Hildegard: Sure, so the widely used ones go at the top. In general, doing a good job at organizing will probably lead to that. But maybe in a less critical script I'm defining a CLI at the bottom and that's where I want argparse and sys if that's the only place I need it [SEP] Hildegard: Sure, but I'm arguing that the reasons that familiar idiom is useful don't vanish in literally all other cases [SEP] Jonas: Interesting brain teaser from our CEO today:\n&gt; Write down the equation:\n&gt; 65 \u2013 43 = 21.\n&gt; You\u2019ll notice that this is not correct. 65 minus 43 equals 22, not 21.

If you look at a typical python project there\u2019s always a requirements.txt (you do ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install those in your environment) with all the packages you need and in the docu the python version the developer has used.

They will be the things that drag you down later on if you don\u2019t have a good understanding of them.\n3. Find a community like this one to ask questions and talk with real programmers. Lose the ego. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions and be curious. Feel the need to tinker and break things. Failure == learning. Be relentless in your pursuit to learning.\n4. Read source code as much as you can. Find the really good projects and study the code line by line. Take it apart, reverse engineer, and learn the inner workings.\n5. Find an open source project to contribute to. We have community projects here btw. This gives you experience with working with version control in a collaborative manner. You also have something to point to in a resume. Being a developer is SO much more than just producing code. There is testing, communication, collaboration, reading other\u2019s code, etc.\n6.

[SEP] Nieves: One sec... [SEP] Ashley: <@Nieves> yeah, selenium is slow because it's dependent on a web browser, and I don't recommend it for scraping (not just because it's dependent on a browser, but because it uses the WebDriver protocol, which can be limiting). Bs4 and requests make a very solid combo, but there's no JS engine involved, so that may limit you in other ways.

It's just an XML parser that was designed with HTML in mind and there's no JS engine involved, but IIRC it knows how to emulate certain behavior should you want to click certain buttons.

Often people would do:\n```def checker(values, past):\n  ... stuff ...\n\ndef main():\n  values, past = check_indices()\n  checker(values, past)```\nThat just makes it more obvious to the reader what kind of data is being generated and passed in. [SEP] Avis: can you suggest any good books or literature  that would fill in the gaps.  what's a little confusing is the fact that arguments we are giving the functions checker is the same as the parameter. [SEP] Sasha: You mean using the same name? Yeah, that needs a little twist of your mindset... `def checker(values, past)` is basically saying, \"Whatever thing is passed to this function in the first parameter, I'm going to label it `values` inside my function code, no matter what it was called before. And the second thing is now labeled `past`, even if the outside variable was named `hot_dogs`.\" [SEP] Sasha: Variable names are intended to help humans reading the code, but to the compiler, their meaning has very strict restrictions, so you want to remember that they're fundamentally arbitrary. [SEP] Avis: ahh:thinking_face: so what's more important is the arguments we are passing the function.rather  than the parameter name ? [SEP] Avis: its making sense :pray: ah man Thanks ! [SEP] Sasha: No problem. Actually, Python can pass arguments both by position and by name. The latter is mostly used if you have a large number of optional arguments. So you might see `foo(one, two, special=True)`, where `one` and `two` are just the generic first and second arguments, but `special` is a named argument. [SEP] Avis: I'll keep that one in mind ....yeah there was some examples on the net some  people using *args and * kwargs as parameters as well [SEP] Sasha: Yep, that's useful when you want to have a function take a variable number of arguments and be able to process them like a list or a dict.

[SEP] Sasha: Almost any data structure will let you find the maximum cost with some sort of a loop, so that'll be relatively easy no matter how you organize things. [SEP] Milly: so for what you provided me before, nothing comes up. so would i put print(max(patients) afterward? because I'm only given the first name and cost as a result and thats not the most expensive. [SEP] Milly: Sorry for all the messages. I've been having the same issue for like two days. :woman-facepalming: [SEP] Sasha: Sorry, just do `print(name, amount)` to display the result. [SEP] Sasha: The answer is just assigned to those variables. [SEP] Milly: Ah! That worked! [SEP] Milly: So the same for minimum I presume. [SEP] Sasha: Yep, just use `min()` instead. [SEP] Milly: Oh the question was second highest. So how would I find that? [SEP] Milly: You're seriously the best! I really appreciate this! [SEP] Sasha: It's not quite the most efficient, but the easiest way is to sort the list, and then you can pick off whatever rank you want. Do you actually want me to show you the answer, or is this a problem you're supposed to solve by yourself, and you just want a hint? [SEP] Milly: No, just you explaining the thought process is helping. I've done the foundation already. But yes, I know about the pop method so I'll try that. [SEP] Milly: I've only learned to programme 4 days ago so I'm still trying to understand how to think \"like a programmer\". [SEP] Sasha: Sure thing, and feel free to ask if you get stuck. You shouldn't really need the `pop()` method, since if you have a sorted list, you can directly access each element by `[0]`, `[1]`, etc. [SEP] Sasha: 4 days? That's awesome! But yeah, it does take some time to gain a problem-solving intuition, especially if you don't know what all the possibilities are yet. [SEP] Milly: Yes, the \"possibilities\"! That's exactly it. [SEP] Milly: &amp; Thank you again! I'll keep cranking away at this code. You said \"feel free to ask\" so I'll be back if I get into any more trouble lol. :grinning: [SEP] Sasha: Absolutely. And if I'm not around, the folks in <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python> and <#C07EFMZ1N|help> are great resources too.", "1784": "Priscilla: I dont know how to tackle this problem. I need to take a serial number from the user, then run a number of functions and have the values from those functions append to the corresponding serial number. Does anyone have any suggestions? [SEP] Priscilla: it must be soooo common [SEP] Sasha: Can you expand on \"append\"? Do you literally mean append to a string, or is it more like the values need to be associated with the serial number in a database? [SEP] Priscilla: litterally append, its all going into a csv and the serial number and all asociated test values will be on the same row [SEP] Sasha: This sounds simple, but there are probably some subtleties. Maybe this:\n```serial = input(\"Please enter your serial: \")\nresult = serial + func1(serial)\nresult += func2(serial)\nresult += func3(serial)```\nIf you have many functions, you can loop over them with a `join()` on the results, too. [SEP] Sasha: Or you could do string formatting: `result = \"{}-{}-{}\".format(serial, func1(serial), func2(serial))`. [SEP] Priscilla: hmmm... the latter was my first idea, but it wasnt working, hangon i got an idea [SEP] Priscilla: ERROR `can only concatenate str (not \"module\") to str` [SEP] Priscilla: expected output needs to be `serial, PASS/FAIL` as you can see on line 5 I convert it to a string but the error seems to think its not a string [SEP] Sasha: Okay, there's a decent amount wrong with this, but which line is throwing the error, to start with? [SEP] Sasha: It sounds like there's some confusion between the `import serial` module and your `serial` variable? [SEP] Priscilla: oh my god i think so... [SEP] Priscilla: line 18 and 20 [SEP] Sasha: How are you calling `keypad_sim_display()`? [SEP] Priscilla: in my main function I have a all the functions running in the order necessary so its like this [SEP] Priscilla: im not going to like what comes next... i can feel it... in mah bones [SEP] Sasha: When you use `serial` there in the function call... where exactly is it coming from? [SEP] Priscilla: its returned from the `ser_num()` at line 3 [SEP] Sasha: If it were returned, you would have `serial = ser_num()`, right? [SEP] Priscilla: so the first thing the user doses is assign a serial number to a device, then the functions lines 6-9 run. if all of those pass according to `keypad_sim_display()` then it will append the word PASS to the serial number [SEP] Priscilla: what do you mean? [SEP] Priscilla: sorry i dont understand your question [SEP] Priscilla: here it is without the conflict of `serial` [SEP] Sasha: When a function returns a value, if you need to do anything with it, you need to capture it to a variable, like `result = foo()`. Otherwise it is just discarded. [SEP] Priscilla: isnt that saving it in a variable on line 4? i thought it was [SEP] Priscilla: or do you mean outside of the function? [SEP] Sasha: Outside of the function. \"What happens in a function, stays in the function\", for the most part. [SEP] Priscilla: oh! i see [SEP] Priscilla: omg omg omg [SEP] Priscilla: im so excited!!  thanks <@Sasha> again! spent hours on that, i learned a LOT whooop whoooooP! [SEP] Priscilla: :tada: [SEP] Priscilla: who pays for this slack room? do we know who is the owner? [SEP] Sasha: AFAIK it's just using the free Slack tier, which is why there's no extended history available. [SEP] Priscilla: oh [SEP] Karoline: there are a couple ancillary services related to the bot and the site and such that are paid for but yeah the slack itself is the free tier [SEP] Priscilla: wubalubadubdub!! [SEP] Priscilla: wouldnt appending a csv be putting a new row and not adding to a row? [SEP] Priscilla: as a programmer, what information comment my work with? name? date? name of program? is there a standard way to do it? or should I leave any identifying information out of it? [SEP] Priscilla: should i put my name or my LLC name? [SEP] Priscilla: eh i put both [SEP] Priscilla: when is a function name too long? [SEP] Conchita: Whenever :point_up::skin-tone-2: question pops into your mind [SEP] Priscilla: good point <@Conchita>", "1785": "Clayton: Anybody use 'SpaCy'  ?", "1786": "Sasha: It varies a lot. Name and date at least is a good way to be able to assert copyright if that's ever needed. Personally I try to also include a program name and just a quick \"what the heck is this thing for\" description to at least jog my memory years from now. [SEP] Sasha: It sort of varies with use. Commonly-used functions ought to be short, like `read()`. If it's specialized and only gets called from one place in one library, go ahead and call it `ReadBudgetSpreadsheetIntoDatabase()`. [SEP] Sasha: But turn off tab completion for a while before you decide long names are fun.  :wink: [SEP] Conchita: Have a feeling <@Sasha>  have the answer [SEP] Sasha: It's a convention for a class-private variable. It's not enforced like some other languages, but it lets other coders know that they're not \"supposed\" to mess with those attributes, at least. [SEP] Sasha: Whereas `client_id` doesn't have that, so it implies that the author of the class allows you to access `foo.client_id` as a public API for the object. [SEP] Conchita: So there are both public and private classes, didn't know that! [SEP] Conchita: And variables [SEP] Sasha: There aren't, from a Python language perspective, but it's a common concept in, say, Java, which can be useful to borrow. [SEP] Conchita: Do you have any example for when its useful with a private class? [SEP] Conchita: Just to get a high-level idea of the use cases [SEP] Conchita: OS and hardware related stuff? [SEP] Sasha: Sure. For instance, say you're writing a class which connects to, say, a USB device. You need to maintain a connection to it, and keep track of particular command sequences. It would be a real problem if some other code came in and just randomly borrowed your connection to send other commands or flip some bits in your state. You want your code to be able to rely on the fact that only you can access and change those things, while providing other users with some friendly functions to call instead. [SEP] Sasha: Again, none of this is actually enforced in Python. It's just a way for people to know that they're \"breaking the rules\" if they start poking at the inner logic of a class. [SEP] Sasha: And sometimes you actually want to break the rules, if you're writing a unit test which wants to examine some of that behavior. [SEP] Conchita: Thanks for the explanation! So its basically a `Don't push this big fat red button` haha [SEP] Sasha: Exactly! [SEP] Conchita: \"Stuff might happen\" [SEP] Conchita: Enjoy the :taco:  <@Sasha> [SEP] Sasha: It can also save you a lot of time in reading other people's code, as you can tell that big long functions starting with an underscore are \"behind the scenes\" and not something that you might need to call to use the library. [SEP] Conchita: Is this what is grouped as \"low-level\"? And maybe part of the reason why its not enforced in Python, as Python is a high-level language? [SEP] Sasha: Not really... low- versus high-level usually refers to how close to the patterns of the underlying hardware you are, like whether you have to worry about CPU registers and memory addresses, or only deal in more abstract things like \"dicts\". [SEP] Conchita: Ok, got it [SEP] Conchita: Another question, do you have a process for reading other people's code? It feels like I spend way to much time to understand code I have NOT written myself (to a level of understanding where I will modify their code) [SEP] Sasha: I tend to work from the \"outside\" moving in. Start with any documentation and public APIs, then a quick scan through the files to just see what is where. Sometimes the unit tests, if there are any, can provide some nice examples of how the functions are called in practice. Then I make sure I understand any key data structures. And lastly just read line by line, hopefully only targeting a section of the code which I know I'm interested in, although sometimes I have to do a code-review of everything. [SEP] Sasha: But it is a learned skill by itself, and reading bad code can be a challenge for anyone. I've been a bit fortunate to mostly work with great coders, so reading their stuff can be a breeze. [SEP] Conchita: That sounds like a nice approach - I started line by line, and later discovered the code was let's call it \"un-impressive\", as it was not functioning as the author claimed + no single line of comment / documentation [SEP] Sasha: Ugh [SEP] Conchita: I'm gonna apply your approach next time! [SEP] Priscilla: <@Sasha> do you have any degrees? [SEP] Priscilla: if you dont mind me asking... [SEP] Sasha: Technically just a bachelors in physics and math, though I went pretty far into a Ph.D. program before dropping out. [SEP] Priscilla: are you glad you got that bachelors? [SEP] Priscilla: i mean like is it relevant to programming and useful in this field? [SEP] Priscilla: assuming this isnt just your hobby but also your hjob [SEP] Sasha: Yes, I think so... IMHO any sort of technical degree is generally useful for developing the sort of rational problem-solving skills that programming relies on. So it's not specifically useful, but it's generally useful. That said, I started programming from a very young age too, so I probably would have ended up doing some level of coding regardless. [SEP] Priscilla: interesting how old are you? [SEP] Sasha: Now? 40's. [SEP] Priscilla: when did you get in tpo programming? [SEP] Sasha: Back in the 80's, the early days of home computers like the Commodore 64. [SEP] Priscilla: haha cool! i work under an engineer at work who used those in college it would be cool to have [SEP] Sasha: Really was a great machine. And it booted up to a BASIC prompt, so the invitation to do some coding was unavoidable. [SEP] Sasha: ```10 PRINT \"HELLO\"\n20 GOTO 10``` [SEP] Priscilla: neat! [SEP] Priscilla: i am looking at learning basic here soon! [SEP] Sasha: It's probably not really worth it these days, except as just an exercise. [SEP] Priscilla: thats why i want to learn it, understand a lower language and the people i talk to its the most relevant languge to them for some reason lol [SEP] Priscilla: every analogy to me (the programmer in the company) is explained in basic lol [SEP] Sasha: Amusing... [SEP] Priscilla: only because they are electrical or mechanical or optical engineers and have only dablled i guess [SEP] Sasha: The limitations of the language sound crazy today.

[SEP] Oretha: The second. I prefer going to the web if I need something in depth, but don\u2019t want to do that to understand how a module or class are put together. I want to avoid breaking flow and feel more productive if I can do all in one place. Eg for the above understanding views by looking at code, autocomplete options, unit test code etc.  [SEP] Karoline: makes sense.  for me - it's a combination of the method completion, exploration via the REPL, and yeah the web and/or Dash (and offline docs tool) [SEP] Karoline: is the standard method completion not working for you?

[SEP] Frankie: the export command is supposed to create it locally, yes [SEP] Frankie: basically I want to create the CSV on the EC2 instance, push it to S3, then delete it from EC2 [SEP] Frankie: every time I deploy [SEP] Frankie: it works to create it on deployment, but won't push to S3...but when I just try to run the command on the EC2 instance, it won't create the damn file and if I sudo it gives me a syntax error. I'm bout to lose it. lol [SEP] Frankie: so at best all I can do right now is redeploy repeatedly to test it, which is annoying cause it takes like 4 minutes to redeploy just to see it fail so it's taking forever to debug it [SEP] Bethany: so you provision the thing, then push some data from it to s3? But where does the data come from originally? [SEP] Frankie: the database connected to the thing :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Bethany: ok so its db -&gt; django on ec2 -&gt; s3? [SEP] Frankie: yes [SEP] Frankie: I guess really it's more like push code to ec2 -&gt; query RDS (database) -&gt; generate csv on ec2 -&gt; push csv to S3 -&gt; delete csv from EC2 [SEP] Bethany: the ec2 stays around afterwards, right? [SEP] Priscilla: I cant seem to figure out how to populate a dictionary with a user-determined number of keys. nothing i try works :facepalm: [SEP] Frankie: actually, the EC2 instance will not stick around afterwards [SEP] Frankie: once the code is deployed successfully it will be replaced by the load balancer [SEP] Frankie: that's why I don't just want to store the csv on EC2...its ephemeral [SEP] Bethany: <@Priscilla> what did you try to do? [SEP] Bethany: ok I'm a bit confused. Once deployed the ec2 gets undeployed or does it get put behin ELB with other instances? [SEP] Priscilla: hangon... trying one more thing that just came to mind [SEP] Hiroko: <@Frankie> the issue seems to be the file doesn't have the necessary system permissions for the management command to access  [SEP] Hiroko: That's what the stack trace is telling you with the permission denied bit  [SEP] Hiroko: So what perms are attached to the file, and what user:group? [SEP] Frankie: <@Bethany> so basically what happens is that when I deploy from my local machine, it uploads a zip file to S3...there is an SQS queue listening for that upload (all this is configured by elastic beanstalk btw), when the SQS queue sees the upload, it first (I think) clones the existing instance to maintain uptime, disconnects the EC2 instance from the load balancer, deploys the new app version, and then reattaches it. when it reattaches it after a successful deployment it will have a new IP. then it terminates the cloned instance [SEP] Frankie: assuming you just have a single instance system. How the load balancer is configured determines how many it'll allow to be running at once, but I just have it allow only two (one for prod and one for staging) [SEP] Priscilla: nope, nothing I try works and this is the only thing I think is close. I tried googling, but found nothing relevant. I am shooting blind here, I don't really know how to implement what i want to do :angry: [SEP] Frankie: <@Hiroko> looks like the perms on the directory I'm trying to create the file in are 755 [SEP] Hiroko: <@Priscilla> you're returning something from the number function but not using it anywhere  [SEP] Hiroko: Eg, no variable in main to store the return value  [SEP] Bethany: <@Priscilla> do you want to keep prompting for input and put the result in a dictionary? [SEP] Bethany: what is the key and what is the value. do you want `my_dict = {\"user_first_input\": ????}` or `my_dict = {??????? : \"user_first_input\"}` and what do you want the  ????? to be [SEP] Priscilla: i would like the user input to the key, because the key is a serial number, and the values will be a list. [SEP] Bethany: and you're storing that list somewhere? [SEP] Priscilla: yes [SEP] Bethany: Ok so you probably have something like: [SEP] Bethany: None [SEP] Priscilla: thats right! [SEP] Bethany: and you want them to pick a list via serial number? Or create this [SEP] Priscilla: no it will go straight to a CSV with one exception [SEP] Priscilla: no wait, I mean it will all be presented to the user, not picked via a serial number [SEP] Hiroko: <@Frankie> no, what I mean is this:\n\n```line 41, in handle\n    with open(filename, 'w') as csv:\nPermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'ACTIVE_USERS_20190427_233356.csv'``` [SEP] Hiroko: that\u2019s in your management command [SEP] Hiroko: its trying to open a file it doesn\u2019t have perms for [SEP] Bethany: <@Priscilla> I'm not quite sure what it is the user is expected to do here. But if you have a dictionary, you can add a key:value pair by simply `d[new_key] = new_value` [SEP] Frankie: <@Hiroko> it's trying to open it with WRITE permissions. the file doesn't exist. the code's trying to create it. [SEP] Hiroko: correct [SEP] Hiroko: which suggests the user:group of the process running the command doesn\u2019t have access to that directory [SEP] Frankie: I agree lol [SEP] Frankie: I don't know what that process is though [SEP] Hiroko: if you ssh into the instance, with the same group, are you able to `touch some_file.txt` in that directory? [SEP] Frankie: yes, if I sudo, but if I sudo as you can see it gives me a syntax error [SEP] Priscilla: i know, im sorry <@Bethany> let me explain entirely. The user will input some serial numbers (corresponding to connected devices) but there is no set number, they will connect anywhere from 1-10 devices. Each device will run through some tests and pass or fail and at the end I need to display this: [SEP] Bethany: oh ok and that is saved to csv as a report or something [SEP] Priscilla: right [SEP] Hiroko: then I would suggest you change things so you don\u2019t have to run that command with `sudo` [SEP] Frankie: that's not the issue. [SEP] Bethany: so it sounds to me you don't actually need a dictionary to store the user input, you could use a list or set [SEP] Frankie: the command runs fine when I deploy the code because the deploy script runs as root [SEP] Frankie: I was just trying to run it locally on EC2 so I didn't have to keep redeploying cause it saves me waiting for 4 damn minutes just to test changing bucket policies 50 times in a row lol [SEP] Priscilla: yes, but the data does need to be ordered, like explicitly in that order `serialnumber, [test1], [test2], [test3]` arent sets unordered? [SEP] Carmen: A set is unordered, yes. [SEP] Frankie: <@Priscilla> `from collections import OrderedDict` ftw! [SEP] Hiroko: well, if you\u2019re using python 3.6+, dicts are ordered by insertion [SEP] Hiroko: 3.6 made it an implementation detail, 3.7 finalized it in the spec [SEP] Bethany: if you need no duplicates but order doesn't matter, `Set`, if you need duplicates and order matters, `list` [SEP] Bethany: <@Hiroko> i thought that was a Cpython implementation detai [SEP] Priscilla: None [SEP] Hiroko: in 3.6, yes [SEP] Bethany: but it's in the spec now? [SEP] Hiroko: correct [SEP] Bethany: oh cool. Still will probably not assume it though [SEP] Hiroko: &gt;&gt;&gt;the insertion-order preservation nature of dict objects has been declared to be an official part of the Python language spec. [SEP] Hiroko: <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html> [SEP] Priscilla: ok so then lists it is [SEP] Bethany: list is a good default choice anyway. [SEP] Hiroko: before, it was an implementation detail of cpython, which excludes pypy [SEP] Hiroko: but now, its part of the spec [SEP] Priscilla: i think i understand lists a little better than the other options [SEP] Frankie: Maybe I'm missing something cause I was half paying attention to your issue/goal <@Priscilla> but this seems kinda trivial to me...what is your goal for user input and what's the goal for output? [SEP] Frankie: are serialnumber1-4 supposed to be entered by the user? [SEP] Priscilla: The goal for input is the serial number of a device then running some functions against it and getting back a pass or fail for each 3 set of functions. Then displaying the serial number and 3 test results to the user. Apparently they will do these devices in a single batch of 10. So the amount of devices (serial number and test results in this convo) may not be a definitive number, ya know? [SEP] Priscilla: does that make sense? [SEP] Clayton: Trying to instantiate an 'argparse' object. Can I just use the built-in code , or do I  need to build my own Class and   add my own arguments ? [SEP] Clayton: <https://github.com/paulgureghian/MXNet_Projects/blob/master/MXNet_Gluon.ipynb> [SEP] Frankie: <@Bethany> lol well I know it's a permissions issue at least ... cause this works :smile:\n```\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"PublicPutObject\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Principal\": \"*\",\n            \"Action\": \"s3:PutObject\",\n            \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::lfa-exports-staging/*\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n``` [SEP] Frankie: translation `run ALLOW_THE_WHOLE_WORLD_TO_WRITE_TO_MY_BUCKET.EXE` [SEP] Frankie: lol [SEP] Frankie: <@Priscilla> yea I get it now [SEP] Frankie: so... [SEP] Frankie: is there an upper limit? [SEP] Frankie: meaning, can they continue entering indefinitely, or should it stop them after `n` serial numbers? [SEP] Priscilla: i am checking [SEP] Priscilla: stop them after 10. No more than 10 can be used on the station right now. [SEP] Frankie: are serial numbers always numbers or can they have letters/chars too? [SEP] Priscilla: letters too [SEP] Priscilla: why do you ask?

It makes it easier for a power-user to copy-paste their data and cut their time typing. [SEP] Carmen: But I happen to be one of those. So it makes sense I'd want that. [SEP] Frankie: well, you could easily add a \"mode\" for \"all at once\" or \"one at a time\" and `python serials.py --mode aao` [SEP] Frankie: :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Frankie: then you could just ask them for a comma separated list of serials [SEP] Frankie: possibilities are really endless there lol but this is also only the first part of the question [SEP] Frankie: <@Priscilla> are you off and running now or do you need help turning the stuff into dicts too? [SEP] Carmen: I'm thinking in terms of \"copy from a spreadsheet corporate sends over\". Spreadsheet columns tend to be copied onto a clipboard as multiple lines separated by newlines. [SEP] Frankie: yeah I agree! [SEP] Frankie: I would def want to just copy/paste and dump it in [SEP] Carmen: The best UIs I've encountered didn't require separate modes, they just figure it out and work intuitively, power-user or not. [SEP] Carmen: Maybe with a confirmation about intent if necessary. [SEP] Carmen: Though I suppose the confirmation here doesn't hurt too much. [SEP] Carmen: You end on the last blank newline and then just have to manually confirm you're done. [SEP] Carmen: Though yes, we're far afield from the original problem statement. [SEP] Priscilla: its going to be entered by a barcode scanner so its easier than copy and paste [SEP] Carmen: Heh. Barcode scanners open you up to all sorts of fun. [SEP] Priscilla: i think this works, im working on making each into its own list, or sub lists havent decided yet [SEP] Carmen: My process optimization senses are tingling. [SEP] Priscilla: <@Carmen> good fun or fun that breaks crap? [SEP] Carmen: Yes. [SEP] Priscilla: oh... [SEP] Carmen: Barcode scanners are effectively keyboards. [SEP] Priscilla: dont they just simulate a keypress? [SEP] Carmen: They just type really, really fast. [SEP] Priscilla: oh [SEP] Carmen: And they're operating on the OS level. So if you get a malicious barcode, it can do things like \"[CMD] + R [newline] cmd.exe [newline] [arbitrary commands here]\" [SEP] Priscilla: so it could potentially jumble the input? [SEP] Carmen: The computer has no idea you want to restrict the input to the active window. It'll let you switch windows with control keys and do anything you could do with a normal keyboard. [SEP] Priscilla: well is that really a threat with barcodes that we print on there? [SEP] Carmen: With your barcodes, no, if you trust your barcode system. [SEP] Priscilla: i mean we make the barcodes. [SEP] Priscilla: ok [SEP] Carmen: But you could have malicious actors adding barcodes to the equipment. [SEP] Carmen: So keep that in mind. [SEP] Priscilla: good point [SEP] Carmen: Though it's worth noting that just as it opens you up to risk, you can also take advantage of that to run very complicated strings of commands/actions from a single barcode scan. [SEP] Carmen: If needed for some reason. [SEP] Frankie: does anyone familiar with AWS know what the difference is between a Role ARN and an Instance Policy ARN?

[SEP] Frankie: the workaround is basically \"do it manually\" which is the whole hting I'm trying to avoid lol [SEP] Frankie: I was just trying to set up an automated DB export of active users, customers and subscriptions to CSV so I could then import the users into mailchimp to build my list the first time, but in doing it I figured it'd be nice to just auto-export a copy of everything each time I deploy so I can always jump into S3 and get an updated view of my users, customers, etc [SEP] Frankie: finally figured it out [SEP] Clayton: Mornin' [SEP] Priscilla: i too would like to know what fixed it <@Frankie> [SEP] Frankie: <@Bethany> <@Priscilla> well I don't know if this is right but basically What I ended up doing was assigning the bucket policy to the same user that manages my static files [SEP] Frankie: instead of assigning it to the role of the EC2 instance [SEP] Frankie: I actually even tried creating a new user specifically for managing this bucket but it seems the `boto` library that interfaces w/ the AWS API needs some extra stuff it's not telling you about in terms of permissions [SEP] Frankie: e.g. it might need to read the ACL of the bucket in order to determine if it's allowed to put stuff in it, or whatever ... [SEP] Priscilla: neat, i think i get it. nice job! :smile: [SEP] Frankie: so the static files user has a bunch more permissions but applying the bucket policy to it strips its permissions down to just `PutObject` and `PutObjectAcl`, along with whatever other stuff it (apparently) needs [SEP] Frankie: I tried to get a file from the bucket w/ that user and tried changing the ACL and stuff like that and it denied me which is what I wanted but it is definitely annoying that I don't actually know what permissions it needs and just have to trust that the developer assigned ones that are safe for what I want. Unfortunately the only way to know for sure would be for me to dig into the source of `boto` but tbh I don't care that much lol [SEP] Priscilla: lol [SEP] Frankie: did you get your dictionary thing figured out? <@Priscilla> [SEP] Frankie: what part are you working on? [SEP] Frankie: I had the rest of it sort of figured out in my head but just needed some more info on how you planned to structure things [SEP] Priscilla: id like each serial number to have its own list, so the only information in each list pertains to that instrument [SEP] Chester: <@Alicia> what problem you're trying to solve? [SEP] Alicia: the problem is related to this stackoverflow issue\n\n<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21784641/installation-issue-with-matplotlib-python> [SEP] Frankie: yea that's pretty simple [SEP] Frankie: <@Priscilla> so you need to iterate through the list of serials and create an empty list as the value of that key in a dict [SEP] Chester: I'm not sure how [SEP] Alicia: In my package at the moment I simply solve this running this code in the __init__ files:\n\n```\n# This piece of code is needed to fix a bug in matplotlib on MacOs\n# see: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21784641/installation-issue-with-matplotlib-python> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nif sys.platform == 'darwin':\n    p = pathlib.Path('~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc')\n    try:\n        with open(os.path.expanduser(p), \"w\", encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            f.write('backend: TkAgg\\n')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n        print('Something went wrong! You have to perform a manual fix.')\n        print(\"To Fix: Add the row 'backend: TkAgg' in the file '~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc'.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Detected the following system platform: {}.\".format(sys.platform))\n    print(\"Not performing matplotlib fix.\")\n``` [SEP] Alicia: but this really slowed down the package import phase somehow [SEP] Frankie: ```\nmydict = {}\nmykeys = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nfor key in mykeys:\n    mydict[key] = []\n\n# or ... \n\nmydict = { key: [] for key in mykeys } # Dictionary comprehension!\n\n# or ... \n\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nmykeys = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nmyvals = [[], [], []]\n# alternatively for myvals:\nmyvals = [[] for key in mykeys] # List comprehension: saves you from typing [], [], [], [] ......... forever\nmydict = OrderedDict(zip(mykeys, myvals))\n``` [SEP] Chester: What about using this instead <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21784641/installation-issue-with-matplotlib-python#comment56913201_21789908> [SEP] Frankie: lots of ways to do it [SEP] Frankie: I quite like the `OrderedDict(zip(keys, vals))` pattern cause it allows you to really see what the vals will be by putting them all in a list [SEP] Frankie: I use it a lot [SEP] Chester: There's also `collections.defaultdict` [SEP] Alicia: mmm I will try that, maybe is better [SEP] Alicia: thanks [SEP] Frankie: damn you person who registered for my site using your weird alphabet! [SEP] Frankie: now I have to deal with stupid unicode lol [SEP] Frankie: does anyone have a preference for CSV files, whether they use tabs or commas as a delimiter? [SEP] Frankie: commas seem annoying cause for field like location you could end up with stuff like `Los Angeles, CA` which throws off the columsn if you don't quote it. [SEP] Frankie: are tabs generally \"better\" to avoid this or should I just use quotes? [SEP] Clayton: If you asked the average Python coder, would they know the difference between an 'expression' and 'statement'  ? [SEP] Frankie: Average? Probably not. lol [SEP] Frankie: I'd argue even a lot of advanced python coders wouldn't know the difference in terms of a strict definition, but probably understand the concept w/o realizing they do. [SEP] Sasha: Personally I always go for tab-separated when I have a choice. Avoids all sorts of problems with escaping and quoting. [SEP] Frankie: that's what I'm thinking too. [SEP] Frankie: is there any risk of spaces being interpreted as tabs in freeform text fields? [SEP] Frankie: only one that's really being a pain is location cause it often has a comma, but I wouldn't put it past an end user to use a tab, for some reason, lol [SEP] Frankie: so I'm thinking I should use tabs, and also quote the location field [SEP] Sasha: If you're handling direct user input, it might be good practice to just do `replace('\\t', ' ')` on everything to be safe. [SEP] Frankie: ok. [SEP] Frankie: it's just this one field so I think I'm just gonna do it in the CSV when I export cause the field isn't super important anyway [SEP] Frankie: but if I wrap the field in quotes won't that prevent the inner tab from being interpreted anyway? [SEP] Sasha: Depends on the parser. If someone does `split('\\t')`, then quotes are ignored. [SEP] Frankie: \"someone\" as in another developer? [SEP] Sasha: Yeah. It's not obvious whether tab-separated files should allow quotes like comma-separated ones do. I might purposefully use that when I want to have unbalanced quotes in my data, for instance. So it depends on what code consumes the file at the other end. [SEP] Frankie: my eyeballs consume it :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Sasha: Heh, then do whatever you want. You're unlikely to be confused with the location field anyway. [SEP] Frankie: but I think this should cover most cases...? [SEP] Frankie: (also, would just writing a newline be sufficient instead of 14 tabs? lol) [SEP] Sasha: Your `replace` parameter is weird, BTW. [SEP] Frankie: probably is no way a tab would ever end up in a username but it's the only other text field so may as well [SEP] Frankie: oh man, yeah you're right haha [SEP] Frankie: `replace('\\t', ' ')` like that? [SEP] Frankie: derp. [SEP] Frankie: lol I don't even know what that is up there. What was I even writing? haha [SEP] Frankie: did you happen to notice the question about just writing a newline in the except block? [SEP] Sasha: It's not obvious what error you are guarding against in the `try` block. What do you expect to possibly go wrong? [SEP] Frankie: well originally I was protecting against unicode errors [SEP] Frankie: but I fixed that w/ encoding='utf-8' when opening the file [SEP] Frankie: so now I'm just protecting against basically anything else that could possibly go wrong since an error in this function would prevent the deployment from completing. [SEP] Frankie: and it's not critical that the CSV has EVERY user in it ... I'd be happy with 99% of them since any it misses on is probably not going to be a good user for me to market stuff to anyway since they most likely did something weird/wrong when registering [SEP] Sasha: Gotcha. I hesitate to suggest it, but if you're guarding against weird-data stuff like that, you might want the `try` at the start of the loop to potentially catch things like `date_joined` being `None` or whatever. [SEP] Sasha: With regard to newline versus a bunch of tabs, since only your eyes are consuming it, it doesn't matter, heh heh. [SEP] Frankie: thanks :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Frankie: it works :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Frankie: it's so purdy heh [SEP] Frankie: good point about the `None` thing btw - however that's an auto-generated field so it should never be `None` [SEP] Frankie: and also I wouldn't want to prevent the whole CSV from being written just cause one user couldn't be written [SEP] Sasha: Right, I didn't mean outside of the loop, just at the start of the logic for each profile. [SEP] Frankie: ahh right [SEP] Frankie: ok. [SEP] Frankie: might be a good idea [SEP] Sasha: You also might consider logging an error message somewhere. [SEP] Frankie: yeah. I mean it will be logged into the activity log on the server (that's where this print output came from) [SEP] Frankie: it's not technically logging but any stdout stuff is maintained in the server's log file [SEP] Frankie: so I can `tail -200 /var/log/eb-activity.log` to see stuff for example [SEP] Sasha: Gotcha. But right now it just silently skips an invalid profile. You might want to print something if the `except` clause is triggered. [SEP] Frankie: ohhh true good point [SEP] Frankie: that's much easier than what I did before which was log into the admin and findthe offending profile based on the ones above/below it, lol [SEP] Frankie: since they are organized in the CSV by date joined it was easy for me to find it but I like your way better [SEP] Frankie: this can definitely be fine tuned now :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Frankie: sweeeet 6561 users exported :open_mouth: [SEP] Frankie: I apologize in advance 6,561 times, but mailchimp here I come.

The `or` operator has to deal with full self-contained expressions, not referencing variables elsewhere in the line. You want `if float_tp4 &gt;= 13.1 or float_tp4 &lt;= 16.5:`. Note also that it's `&gt;=` rather than `=&gt;`. [SEP] Priscilla: aha [SEP] Priscilla: in between [SEP] Sasha: There's a handy shortcut for that: `if 13.1 &lt;= float_tp4 &lt;= 16.5`.

[SEP] Priscilla: i changed them though [SEP] Priscilla: your way is much more readable i think [SEP] Priscilla: what do you think? I am going to run this for all of the test points then use a function called `report()` to check all the test points to be true or false. and if any are false then `report()` will return `FAIL` [SEP] Sasha: You should probably get into the habit of searching for `\"= print\"` in your code. Every time you do that, it's a mistake, since `print()` always returns `None`. [SEP] Priscilla: is this the correct way? [SEP] Sasha: Yep. You can also just `return 'pass'` if you want to.

[SEP] Frankie: man this integration is so freakin cool [SEP] Sasha: The notch was a write-protect tab... open for writeable, or you could cover it up with tape to write-protect it.

If the values in `list_index_ master_dataframe` are unique you can speed up your work by making that a dict, with all the values the keys, and an empty value. This will speed it up because you are going from O(n) for the list evaluation to amortized O(1) dict key lookup [SEP] Clemmie: also - I don\u2019t know dataframes so well - but to me `master_dataframe.loc[each, 'nans CH'] = 'nan'` sure looks like it is doing a lookup. You can probably get rid of `if each in list_indexes_master_dataframe:` and just wrap `master_dataframe.loc[each, 'nans CH'] = 'nan'` in a try/except [SEP] Ming: Yep. The second part makes sense.

[SEP] Hiroko: <@Ming> the difference is in the lookup [SEP] Hiroko: with a list, you have to iterate through each and every index [SEP] Hiroko: with a dict, you just need the key for a lookup [SEP] Clemmie: but if you wrapped the try except it doesn\u2019t look like you even need `list_index_ master_dataframe` anymore [SEP] Ming: Yes. You are right [SEP] Nola: trying to make a loop or function that takes all churns from data_2, and puts them into data_1? [SEP] Ming: Actually the try doesn't quite work because it will always work.

[SEP] Ming: Sorry, another question [SEP] Nola: np [SEP] Marth: <@Nola> what about a merge? `df = data_1.merge(data_2)`  or if you want to replace data_1 `data_1 = data_1.merge(data_2)` [SEP] Marth: merge also has options if your data is more complex than your sample [SEP] Nola: like this example [SEP] Nola: Everytime I use merge, it removes values not found [SEP] Ming: Using the dict worked very well.

He then came to me asking for help, I told him the project was basically all over the place and he needed to start over and go back to the course materials, he assured me it was all his work after I questioned it that time and said he would redo it...3 days later, this giant project all in one commit again like he did it all in three days? this guy is a student, not a seasoned developer so it makes me question this a lot.

What am I doing wrong? [SEP] Nenita: nvm [SEP] Nenita: just saw my dictionary isnt built properly [SEP] Nenita: alright so my code works fine and all, but when exporting my dataframe, it doesn't retain the values that have been inserted? [SEP] Nenita: if i print the row data as the code is running, it will show that the data has been inserted into the correct location, but it doesn't show any data was inserted after exporting the dataframe [SEP] Sasha: Sounds like you've done something to duplicate the dataframe along the way, and are exporting a different variable than the one you're modifying. [SEP] Sasha: Some Pandas calls return a new dataframe rather than modify the original. [SEP] Nenita: ive never encountered this issue before and i just insert the same df into each function.

The documentation for `iterrows()` says, \"You should never modify something you are iterating over. This is not guaranteed to work in all cases. Depending on the data types, the iterator returns a copy and not a view, and writing to it will have no effect.\" So when you are changing `data[]` values, it isn't necessarily getting propagated into the dataframe.

You can (a) use a global variable, (b) have the function return the data, or (c) pass in some kind of container to the function for it to modify. Sometimes this sort of need is also a sign that you may want to have the functions as part of a class with shared state. [SEP] Priscilla: i looked into that and I dont really understand shared states, and not even really classes [SEP] Priscilla: unfortunately I dont have time to try and implement that right now ya know [SEP] Sasha: A class is \"smart data\", in that it can store things, but also knows how to do things with that data.

It holds things, and can know how to work with them. A class is a recipe to make a bucket [SEP] Sasha: Python creates the object for you and then calls `__init__` for you to flesh it out, but it's already created by the time you get it, so you don't have to return anything.

[SEP] Mildred: is this the same script you also just asked about in introductions and random channels? [SEP] Donna: Yes. [SEP] Donna: I figured this was the place to get some help. [SEP] Mildred: ok, lets keep it to one channel for now :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nClick on the plus to the left of the window and paste in a code snippet so we can take a look at what you are doing [SEP] Donna: Got it! [SEP] Donna: here's the goal [SEP] Donna: You'll want to write a Python program to:\n(1) for each of the first five links read the html text content of each website (that is to say, read the three character \"code\" for each),\n(2) concatenate the five parts together in order (first website part + second website part + ...),\n(3) append the resulting 15 character \"code\" to the validation url in the place of the string \"&lt;clock pts&gt;\", and\n(4) read the html text content of the website with the derived url. [SEP] Donna: None [SEP] Donna: That's how far i got. [SEP] Mildred: not my strong suit, but i would imagine you have to do something with webscaping, probably the request module [SEP] Sasha: Yep, I'd say your next step is reading some of the documentation for the `requests` library. [SEP] Mildred: something like:\n\nFor each in urls:\n    text.append(request(url[each]) [SEP] Sasha: A simple issue that will probably catch you by surprise is that you need commas between your URLs to make a list, as right now the strings will be appended into one large one. [SEP] Donna: None [SEP] Donna: Here is one of my first trys an hour ago. [SEP] Sasha: Cool. Did that work? [SEP] Donna: Yes, but I need to all all 5 links and responses, then concat all of them [SEP] Sasha: I'm not sure how much of a beginner you are. Are you familiar with `for` loops? [SEP] Donna: I'll say I know nothing. Like watched 10 videos, fresh off the python boat. [SEP] Donna: Read this: <https://realpython.com/python-requests/> [SEP] Mildred: i would be suprosed if you didnt know loops after watching 10 videos.\n\nOutside of what a variable is, its right up on the list [SEP] Sasha: Okay, the simplest form of a `for` loop allows you to repeat a section of code for a sequence of values. For instance:\n```nums = [1, 2, 3]\nfor x in nums:\n  print(x)```\nwould output:\n```1\n2\n3``` [SEP] Sasha: So you can use this to execute your `requests` code for each URL in your list. [SEP] Sasha: Appending strings together just uses the `+` operator, like `\"a\" + \"b\"` produces `\"ab\"`. [SEP] Sasha: I feel that I should tell you that the cybersecurity program you're enrolled in is likely to get exponentially more difficult than this sort of initial exercise. [SEP] Donna: Correct but this task outside of my normal \"work\" [SEP] Donna: I'm using these small tasks to learn python [SEP] Sasha: Gotcha. [SEP] Conchita: `for` loops are important to understand. Haven't seen exactly this video, but each time I watch a Corey Schafer tutorial I feel I go from being painfully ignorant about a topic (ie TDD) and 15 minutes later, I understand the basic concepts.\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iF8Xb7Z3wQ> [SEP] Raguel: Oh yeah \u2014 he is great.

[SEP] Priscilla: holy crap my pc has 256 com ports available... so i guess it can. [SEP] Sasha: It may become difficult to know which serial is attached to which com port. So if there's any way to read off the serial number from the device itself, you might consider that.

[SEP] Priscilla: so then I need it to run this class on the first serial number (on each 3 ports within that class) and then iterate to the next serial number [SEP] Priscilla: what do you mean? [SEP] Sasha: Well, if these are USB devices, the com ports would typically get dynamically assigned based on the order that things are plugged in, or discovered.

[SEP] Jonas: I remember seeing a free port fixture around somewhere, but I cannot find it for the life of me [SEP] Jonas: (yes, race conditions etc, but it's a lot better than what we have now) [SEP] Philip: I hope this helps :slightly_smiling_face: <https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/> [SEP] Chester: <@Dawn> okay, so you think your code is ugly mostly because it violates the single responsibility principle, a lot :slightly_smiling_face:\nI see thee different blocks of code that should be extracted into their own functions:\n1) `doc`, `question` and `answers` parsing logic - some fields are optional, some fields need to be converted, etc.\n2) mapping between parsed `doc` fields and `target` fields\n3) I/O, data insertion into the database [SEP] Chester: Once you extract parsing logic into its own function, you'll be able to implement mapping as a static dictionary [SEP] Chester: e.g.\n```\nMAPPED_FIELDS = {\n    '_id': 'ID',\n    'createdAt': 'CreatedAt',\n    ...\n}\nmapped = {}\nfor key, value in parsed_doc.items():\n    mapped_key = MAPPED_FIELDS[key]\n    mapped[mapped_key] = value\n``` [SEP] Chester: viola, you now have a generic mapper function that only needs a mapping dictionary as input [SEP] Dawn: Looks nice, thanks", "1998": "Leida: first, we dont know where the text comes from - im assuming you can get it line by line [SEP] Leida: you dont need to get the shard if the ip is wrong so on each line you can call ```if \"10.65.41.35\" in line:``` [SEP] Leida: where `line` is the variable that contains the line of text [SEP] Leida: next up you could get the location of the substring using the `find()` function [SEP] Leida: something like ```line.find(\"_shard\")``` [SEP] Leida: that would give you the index for the _ character [SEP] Leida: if you add 6 to it you should have the index for the shard number [SEP] Leida: if you know there are less than 10 shards then you could just get the character from that location, if it can be longer then then you should search for the next occurance of _ and subtracting 1 from the index of it to get the index of the last number, then anything between those two is the shard number [SEP] Leida: is the shard number even what you are looking for? [SEP] Lanelle: <@Leida> sure what would be the snippet [SEP] Leida: ```\nif \"10.65.41.35\" in line:\n  index = line.find(\"_shard\")\n  shard_number = line[index+6]``` [SEP] Leida: you can get an error if line is shorter than `index + 6` tho [SEP] Lanelle: are u going to also  have\n```f=open('file','r')\nline=f.readlines()``` [SEP] Leida: `with open(\u201cfilename\u201d) as file: ` [SEP] Leida: ```\nwith open(\"filename\") as file:\n  for line in file:\n    if \"10.65.41.35\" in line:\n      index = line.find(\"_shard\")\n      shard_number = line[index+6]``` [SEP] Leida: you can add checking if `_shard` was found (find returns -1 if not found) and check the length of line before you try to use an index on it and well maybe replace the 6 with `len(\"_shard\")` so that there are no magic numbers [SEP] Jamey: I would like some help clarifying if I have a correct data model. My end goal is to have something that allows users to create their own data models for risks.  Users should be able to make their own risk types and attach as many different fields as they like. I want to avoid having database tables that are called `automobiles`, `houses` etc. Fields would be stuff like `first name`, `age`, `serial number` etc i.e. anything the user would want to collect about the risk in question. Fields can be of different types e.g. `text`, `date`, `number`, `currency` etc. [SEP] Jamey: My model at present is as follows: A one to many relationship between `RiskType` and `FieldType`, then a one to many relationship between `Field` and `FieldType`. [SEP] Jamey: <@Chester> the idea is to use this to create an API where users can make their own risks that they'd like to be insured for. [SEP] Chester: Okay, I repeat my question :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Dawn: Thanks, but with this there's still the problem of nested objects. I have a lot of those and they all look different. Sometimes it's even a nested doc in a nested doc in an array in a nested doc... [SEP] Chester: I can rephrase: what would this api give me that a sticky notes app doesn't have? [SEP] Chester: Write a separate parser/mapper for each nested doc. [SEP] Jamey: It gives me a use case where I write code that demonstrates my abilities to write an API using DRF. :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Jamey: Yes, but that anything needs to be something that I can write up in an Entity Relationship Diagram. [SEP] Chester: Maybe a JSONB field is easier to work with if your schema isn't strictly defined [SEP] Chester: ER diagram only makes sense for strictly defined schemas [SEP] Jamey: I was just asking to make sure I had the relationships laid out correctly. [SEP] Jamey: The idea is that it should be strictly defined, yes. Or at least that's what is implied by asking for a ER diagram to go along with your classes. [SEP] Chester: :thinking_face: [SEP] Chester: How can you strictly define a schema if you allow users to change it as they wish? [SEP] Chester: What you're looking for is <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model> [SEP] Jamey: I think the idea (as I understand it) is that you expose field types e.g. `text`, `numbers` etc to a user so that they can make their own field e.g. a `name` field of `text` type. [SEP] Jamey: Yes. I think it is what I am looking for. Thanks. :taco: <@Chester>. I'll start from there then.", "1999": "Chester: What would you do with that data?

We presented several forms that created the `Question` model with the right schema [SEP] Jonas: i.e a form with `max_length`, `min_value` etc. These are all just `**kwargs` to a `Field` instance. Once validated, we know they work, and can dynamically create a `Question` form at any time with `field_classes[field_type](**question_instance.args)` [SEP] Jamey: <@Jonas> :taco: for sharing.

[SEP] Leida: i installed a separate python version before starting to mess with the project and i set that python version in the pyenv, so i can use the same packages jumping from one project to another [SEP] Leida: some args yes [SEP] Leida: the args are paths to files outside of the project tho [SEP] Leida: didnt copy over my test data, rather gave them as inputs to my script with extra relative pathing [SEP] Ashley: just a heads up regarding the virtual envs, they install a duplicate of the python binary you tell them, and that duplicate will point to it's own site-packages folder (so it has it's own set of packages \"installed\" there, and it doesn't utilize any pacakges from the copy of python it was duplicated from) [SEP] Ashley: so you don't have to go out of your way to install another copy of python yourself [SEP] Ashley: it bassically does that for you [SEP] Ashley: not sure if that's what you meant though [SEP] Ashley: but anyway, it sounds like that should work then [SEP] Leida: ok, well i guess ill create a virtualenv for that porject, try with only the needed packages and see what happens [SEP] Ashley: worth a shot [SEP] Ashley: I'll try my own little experiment to see what it does [SEP] Leida: thanks alot for taking your time walking me through this <@Ashley> :taco: [SEP] Ashley: no problem [SEP] Ashley: also, I can recreate it [SEP] Ashley: so you're not alone [SEP] Ashley: I'm guessing that because you're passing python `app/src/application.py`, it only cares about `application.py`'s immediate folder [SEP] Ashley: I'm gonna try something [SEP] Leida: there was something about trying to run the file as a module somewhere on stackexchange but i didnt get far with it [SEP] Ashley: interesting [SEP] Ashley: ```\n$ python app/thing.py \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"app/thing.py\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n    from .src import application\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named '__main__.src'; '__main__' is not a package\n``` [SEP] Ashley: ok, so it looks like I was right [SEP] Ashley: because you are calling `python app/src/application.py`, your context is limited to the `app/src/` directory [SEP] Ashley: basically, python doesn't care about anything above that folder, because you didn't treat the whole thing like it was a package [SEP] Ashley: so now the solution [SEP] Ashley: `python -m app.src.application some args` [SEP] Ashley: that treats `app/src/application.py` as a module within a larger package [SEP] Holly: I actually used zlib here to decompress the messages on the fly so I could then decode them without issue :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Gemma: Nice so your hunch that they were compressed was correct! [SEP] Leida: and now does work [SEP] Leida: only question i have is is this the right way? [SEP] Leida: how does one evoke the bot that writes about asking questions? [SEP] Leana: If you have a question, please just ask it. Please do not ask for topic experts;  do not DM or ping random users. We cannot begin to answer a question until we actually get a question. \n\n<http://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html|*Asking Questions*> [SEP] Jimmy: `/justask` [SEP] Hiroko: None [SEP] Ashley: <@Leida> it's the right way for some things. I would just make sure you have that `if __name__ == '__main__':` bit in there so you can explicitly provide behavior you want when that module is called directly. Other than that, I would make sure you have the `__main__.py` module in the root with the appropriate behavior (once the time comes for you app to actually be used like one) so you can call the \"app\" directly [SEP] Leida: thanks, i do have `__name__ ==` bit already, trying to use it for manual testing [SEP] Ashley: it's also a good idea to consider the behavior you're testing, and try to build unit tests that validate it [SEP] Ashley: that way you get the tests in at the same time that you implement the behavior [SEP] Leida: i know its good i just have never gotten to doing it proper... [SEP] Leida: currently im supposed to build a microservice around a prebuilt model of a face detection network [SEP] Leida: i started off with trying to get to grips with tensorflow enough to even run the model properly [SEP] Leida: so now that i have something working im refactoring it into a project with web oriented layout [SEP] Leida: so i dont know exactly when or which bits i would test [SEP] Leida: like right now i test that the script works and i get a properly detected image out, this is human verifiable, but the api would just give the boxes coordinates [SEP] Leida: is there any good resource how to get the workflow right that is python oriented? [SEP] Ashley: <@Leida> just make sure you treat things that are basically a tool (in this case, something that can detect faces and return a bounding box) as a separate resource. That'll make compartmentalization simpler and help you avoid things getting tightly coupled. Your microservice itself should be able to treat the face detection tool as a black box that it just passes an image (or image location) to and gets back the bounding box. This makes your code less coupled, and makes writing tests much easier [SEP] Ashley: I would recommend trying to create an importable package that you can keep totally separate of your microservice's code. That way, you can install that package in the environment your microservice will use, and then it can just do `from facenet import detect_face` and then just call `bounding_box = detect_face(image_location)` [SEP] Leida: umm so i would have the detection logic in a separate repo and pull it in as a submodule to the api repo? [SEP] Ashley: I wouldn't say separate repo necessarily [SEP] Ashley: you can definitely have it in the same repo [SEP] Ashley: sometimes having a separate package entirely is a bit much, so I like to have a `utils` subpackage in the root package where I keep the source for those types of tools. [SEP] Ashley: then I can do `from app.utils import detect_face` [SEP] Ashley: it's still almost entirely separate form the app's code, and you can have your app still treat it like a black box [SEP] Ashley: at that point, it's really just personal preference [SEP] Leida: well what i have is app.py to deal with the api that imports application.py that has the face detection business logic [SEP] Leida: and i have utilities folder that keeps the visualizer code that takes the image and the boxes and draws em on [SEP] Holly: yeah the starting bytes of 0x8b and 1xf were the giveaway once I really looked, then it was just a matter of taking the decompressed decoded data, doing a `literal_eval` to turn it to a dict then parsing it all out into log files was a synch! [SEP] Ashley: I would suggest asking if you could see something being reasonably used as a standalone tool. If so, it should be in that utils subpackage [SEP] Ashley: Or it's own package [SEP] Leida: hmm so my visualizer could be a method in the face detection class and the class as an utility? [SEP] Ashley: Remember to keep it compartmentalized and decoupled [SEP] Ashley: Detecting a face isn't related to drawing a square on an image given some coordinates [SEP] Ashley: I don't know how you're visualizing it, but you don't need to detect a face to visualize some info. The info you get from the face detection process just happens to be the info you want to visualize [SEP] Jimmy: maybe <@Elaine> can help you with that. he often answer in <#CCC8SRJHX|documentation> about sphinx question (hopefully the ping doesn't annoys you <@Elaine> :slightly_smiling_face: ) [SEP] Leana: If you have a question, please just ask it.

I have a bit of an implementation problem and I'd like your professional suggestion. I'm using FlaskSQLAlchemy for the management of the database object.\n\nIn my project, which you can think of as a SaaS, when you create a Company(sort of), this company has to subscribe by making payment to _my_ company. This subscription could be for a month, a quarter/half of a year, or it cover a whole year. When the company's subscription is active, all routes in _my_ company's API would be accessible but immediately the subscription expires, none of the routes become accessible. It sends you a *subscription ended* RESTful result.\n\nNow, there's a model `Company` that has several columns, one of each is `subscriptions` which is *supposed* to hold all the subscriptions that a company has made including the expired subscriptions and the current active one. \n\n```\nclass Company (db.Model):\n    __tablename__ = 'companies'\n    subscriptions = db.relationship('Subscription', backref='company', lazy='dynamic')\n   # followed by several other columns\n\nclass Subscription (db.Model):\n# stuffs\n\n```\n\nNow my question is, how do you think I can implement the subscription 'model' such that when I add a `@active_subscription_on` decorator on a route, this decorator checks the current user's company's subscription to see if their subscription is active?\n\nHow can I implement the subscription system? [SEP] Tam: Here's what I've thought of(although I haven't implemented it): when your company _clicks_ on buy subscription(to generate a key, think Windows OS serial key), for a month, I use `itsdangerous`'s `TimedJSONWebSignatureSerializer` to encode the duration of the subscription, then use `base64` on the result for something readable. That gives me the key to give to the company and when entered to extend their subscription days, I simply reverse the process to get the duration the subscription will cover. I can then add this period to the company's list of subscriptions. \n\nNow, I don't really know how to make the decorator gain access to this information and be quick with it!

What am i doing wrong? [SEP] Sasha: Your `report()` function would want to store the output in `self.output_csv`. If it's just a function-local variable, it disappears when the function exits. [SEP] Priscilla: yeah it is a local variable and i do need it to disappear, looks like i need a workaround. [SEP] Sasha: Can you clarify why you need it to disappear? [SEP] Sasha: Looks like you need it to remain around for a while, to write it. [SEP] Priscilla: so i updated it with the timed loop I need the for loop to run within. there is another loop inside of the function `report()` I need to write it after the time loops finish, so I took the write statment out of the `report()` function. [SEP] Priscilla: here is the function [SEP] Sasha: Do you need the output to be a combination of all of the output from the different serials, and write it when all of them are done? [SEP] Priscilla: yes [SEP] Sasha: Okay, in that case you need to have `output_csv` be a variable in your top-level code, and have each device return their part to be appended. For instance, in `report()` you would have `return output_str, output_csv`, and in the outer loop you'd have something like:\n```output_csv = ''\nfor s in serials:\n  device = BurnIn(s, usr)\n  output, csv = device.report()\n  print(output)\n  output_csv += csv\nwith open('csvfile.csv', 'a') as f:\n  f.write(output_csv)``` [SEP] Sasha: However, I might reconsider the requirement to write the output at the very end. With append mode, you can write as you go, and it might suck to lose all your data if the program crashes before it finishes. [SEP] Priscilla: ok, now that was one of my first plans. the problem is that `report()` does not return `output` it returns a similar string with spaces in it to display a kind of \"table\" so its not really comma seperated. [SEP] Priscilla: and i will take your advice on appending, instead of writting. [SEP] Priscilla: because it prints out the statuse every minute, but only appends to the csv after the full 24 hours have finished [SEP] Sasha: That's why I said you should `return output_str, output_csv` in `report()`, to get access to both the printable text and the CSV data. [SEP] Priscilla: how neat, how does it know to assign to `output` and `csv` respectively? [SEP] Priscilla: oh,\n`output, csv = ...`\nand\n`return output, csv`\ni guess [SEP] Sasha: Yep. It's actually returning a 2-element tuple, and unpacking it when you assign the return value to 2 variables. [SEP] Priscilla: very cool [SEP] Hsiu: That\u2019s why a stray comma can make your code behave in unexpected ways. `x = 1,` means `x = (1, )` (a tuple, not an int) [SEP] Priscilla: that makes a lot of sense [SEP] Priscilla: for some reason this\n```\ndef keypad_sim(self):\n      ser_menu = 'PASS'\n      self.keypad_sim_list.append(ser_menu)\n```\ngives me a `memory error` i guess its from ram getting full.

[SEP] Chester: Uhm, why? [SEP] Pura: I need to wait until the rate limit has reset before continuing with the tasks [SEP] Pura: so i set a sleep to try and do this [SEP] Chester: You still want the event loop to roll. With `time.sleep` you essentially block everything from running, including various IO readiness checks, which is really really bad. You don't want to do this in asyncio-based application [SEP] Pura: Okay [SEP] Pura: but if i need to have some feature to wait for 15 minutes before continuning running of the tasks/co-routines how could i do this [SEP] Pura: pause all tasks for 15 minutes depending on some condition [SEP] Chester: RDS [SEP] Chester: It's kind of weird requirement. What if one of the tasks is in the middle of DB transaction? [SEP] Pura: ye true [SEP] Tatum: I'm currently on GCS. [SEP] Pura: there must be a better way to seperate this code then [SEP] Chester: GCS? Google cloud? [SEP] Karoline: I imagine they have a similar managed DB service. [SEP] Tatum: Yup. I'll take a poke around. It may be worth migrating to AWS as you can't take chances with backing up data. Thanks! [SEP] Pura: because i need someway to pause these operations because my app is rate limited [SEP] Tatum: Yes, Google Cloud Services [SEP] Chester: I'd say you don't need to pause operations. You need to stop scheduling operations when you face a rate limiting action. [SEP] Karoline: at this point with RDS we're comfortable enough with the restore process that we actually use it for troubleshooting as well - we'll replicate prod for really hard to reproduce issues and test against that, it's stupid easy. [SEP] Chester: RDS is also nice because it's your lovely postgres under the hood. There is no vendor lock-in, really.\nYou can just `pg_dump` your whole data any time, and migrate somewhere else [SEP] Pura: hmm interesting what if the operation youre currently on faced a rate limit action and you need to repeat it? [SEP] Karoline: We also had to increase the size of our prod database and it was as easy as editing the size of of disk allocated to it.  It's an incredible product really. [SEP] Chester: Put it in a waiting queue; replay the queue when it's possible [SEP] Chester: I wish all aws products were like RDS... [SEP] Hiroko: so I doubt you need to go from GC to AWS just for this thing [SEP] Karoline: haha yeah it definitely stands out as one of their best designed.  not everything is so nice for sure [SEP] Karoline: yeah my guess is there's something similar on google, it's pretty fundamental [SEP] Pura: At the moment i scheduled operations in batches like this\n\n```\n   for i, batch in enumerate(batches):\n            tasks = [asyncio.ensure_future(fetch_user_objects(apps, session, user_id=users, tweet_mode=\"extended\")) for users in batch]\n            for t in tasks:\n                d = await t\n```\n\nDo you recommend another method? i batch request 10 at a time otherwise the process is so slow [SEP] Tatum: Thanks guys! Much appreciated. I found GCS has had to list their matching services with AWS. <https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/map-aws-google-cloud-platform> [SEP] Karoline: awesome, I'd be curious to hear your experience after you play with it for a bit. [SEP] Karoline: also, don't forget, you don't really have a backup until you've restored from it.  so make sure you test out your restore process. [SEP] Tatum: So true. I recently tried a backup script and couldn't restore it. :scream_cat: Luckily it was all fake data I inserted in a development environment [SEP] Chester: I guess `asyncio.gather` would be easier [SEP] Pura: i mean how would you implement the \u201cstop scheduling if the fetch_user_object\u201d hit a rate limit action [SEP] Chester: People can be in three groups:\n\u2022 ones who don't make backups yet\n\u2022 ones who do\n\u2022 ones who test restoration procedure [SEP] Pura: ah the problem is that rate limit action might be for 1 app, but i need to stop scheduling if all the apps hit the rate limit [SEP] Karoline: haha yes. [SEP] Karoline: oh, and people who think RAID is backup.  lol [SEP] Pura: the `fetch_user_objects` takes in `apps` as a parameter so i could check to see if all apps are rate limited in this function by adding some flag and if they are return some error response.\n\ni would have to make apps a global variable so that the state is persisted? [SEP] Chester: &gt; how would you implement the \u201cstop scheduling if the fetch_user_object\u201d hit a rate limit action\nJust put a `await asyncio.sleep()` right before your `asyncio.ensure_future` calls. [SEP] Chester: I guess they fall into the first group :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Pura: i only sleep based on some condition that would be sleeping before everything? [SEP] Chester: Sure, you need to do a conditional sleep. Is that a problem? :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Pura: yes because i need to return a response from one of these ensure futures first [SEP] Chester: ```\n    for i, batch in enumerate(batches):\n        if rate_limited():\n            await asyncio.sleep(some_time)\n        tasks = [asyncio.ensure_future(fetch_user_objects(apps, session, user_id=users, tweet_mode=\"extended\")) for users in batch]\n        for t in tasks:\n            d = await t\n``` [SEP] Pura: and this rate_limited() function could loop through all the apps and check if the flag self.rate_limit = True [SEP] Pura: this self.rate_limit = True is set within `fetch_user_objects` if it hits a 429 error from the http request [SEP] Pura: the last problem i think i see here is\u2026 this ensure_future is batch of 10 requests. If in the 5th request everything is rate limited, i would need to sleep\u2026 [SEP] Chester: Alright, so this is a problem only if the remaining tasks haven't made rate-limited requests yet. Because if they already made requests, then they weren't really rate limited, right? Otherwise the remaining tasks will fail with some exception like `HttpTooManyRequests` - which is fine, because you can re-schedule failed tasks to the next batch [SEP] Chester: But if the remaining tasks have made their requests, and they were not rate limited, then you don't care about them - they are free to go and save data to a db. You don't need to do anything with them, just let them finish [SEP] Linnea: I am following this article [SEP] Linnea: <https://help.github.com/en/articles/enabling-branch-restrictions> [SEP] Chester: By default, nobody can push to your repository except for you. [SEP] Chester: You can add collaborators with different permissions (basically, \"write\" and \"admin\") [SEP] Chester: So if you don't add anyone to your repo - you're good, others can only try to push their code through PRs [SEP] Pura: yes, how do you reccomend rescheduling failed tasks.\n\n`d = await t`\n\nshould i check the response of `d` and then retry based on that response and is there already a way to retry easily using asyncio? [SEP] Chester: &gt; should i check the response of `d` and then retry based on that response\nYep. If there's an exception, you'll need `try`/`except` over `d = await t` [SEP] Linnea: It seems they all have push access by default. There is no place to change permissions for collaborators [SEP] Pura: ahh okay, ye there is no exception in my fetch_user_objects i have\n\n```\nif response['status'] != 200:\n        app.rate_limited = True\n        return {'errors': 'failed job'}\n```\n\nso i could look for `d['errors']` or maybe return some status [SEP] Pura: im just not sure how i would go about rescheudling this task then.\n\n```\nfor task in tasks:\n    res = await task\n```\n\ntask i believe is the future/co-routine [SEP] Chester: I'd remove users from collaborators.

Webapps hosted thereon, and health checks on the servers themselves (disk usage, inode creep, etc.) [SEP] Walton: Well VM or bare metal doesn't matter, all that matters is that it has a pulse[IP]. You can monitor everything, from ports, to storage, to logs, to ssh traffic. Basically everything for a production web environment, Nagios has got you covered. That isn't to say Prometheus or any other suggestion is bad, I just have not worked with those at all. As a guy who just started learning python, I had Nagios fully functional for day to day and the DEV team at my last spot, with zero python knowledge. [SEP] Walton: now if you're talking about centralized logging type monitoring, I'd recommend an ELK stack [SEP] Carmen: At the moment, I'm more concerned with making sure everything is alive and not dying rather than metrics tracking. ELK is my target for centralized logging and metrics tracking later on. [SEP] Walton: well ping is the default module for Nagios. however, to me that means nothing, as a machine can be a vegetable. [SEP] Walton: I'd branch out from there and turn on port monitoring. [SEP] Walton: for HTTP/S I'd have a healthcheck page and check it for a return to make sure metadata is present, this way you'd know that not only is port 80/443 is open but it is hosting too [SEP] Walton: you can do SSH monitoring to see if accounts outside a list of accounts is trying to login. [SEP] Walton: and from there, storage, ram, cpu monitoring. only set it to alert you and your team when there is a problem, and a \"everything works\" alert daily so you know it's all still running [SEP] Walton: then with grafana or the built in NAGIOS mappign tool, you can have a dedicated monitor with a topography map of your entire map, looking to see if errors pop up [SEP] Walton: My apologies to everyone for going off-topic on this. its just the only thing I can actually contribute with at the moment with my current skillset.

I have tried updating pip without have the virtualenvironment active, upgrading pip in virtual environment. But both do not upgrade the version of pip that is installed when I use venv to create my next virtual environment [SEP] Sterling: So how do you upgrade the pip package that is being used to create virtualenvironments by venv? Do I have to upgrade venv itself? If so, how? [SEP] Sterling: thats the exact version I have when I use PIP in venv. 10.0.1. So am I stuck with 10.0.1 on fresh VENV until I update it inside the venv or that cpython gets updated? [SEP] Nigel: Usually you can install virtualenv as a separate package for your OS, it usually installs the new version of pip [SEP] Sterling: I used to use virtualenv but recently I saw that python docs were recommending `python3 -m venv tutorial-env`. Do you know if there is any reason why they suggest that module now over virtualenv package I used to use? [SEP] Sterling: The only reason I switched was because docs were using it [SEP] Nigel: &gt; Do you know if there is any reason why they suggest that module now over virtualenv package I used to use?\nThe reason is that they'be brought virtualenv into the distribution of python [SEP] Nigel: I don't know if I'm correct, but I'm pretty sure about it [SEP] Nigel: There are also tools which help you with creating virtual environments without thinking too much about them. The best of such tools is called poetry: <https://github.com/sdispater/poetry> [SEP] Sterling: What do you guys use? [SEP] Nigel: It handles virtual environments and packaging [SEP] Nigel: There is also virtualenvwrapper (<https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>) which I used to use before, and pipenv (<https://github.com/pypa/pipenv>) [SEP] Brain: I don\u2019t think you can really solve this in any permanent way. Every time a new version of `pip` releases, you\u2019ll see that message.\nIt takes time to update that version in `virtualenv`, `venv` and other packages. So, on your system `pip` will always be lagging behind unless you upgrade it right after creating venv.

[SEP] Sterling: I do [SEP] Sterling: I have a mac and python2 was preinstalled. But I installed python3 via homebrew. When I rune the venv module though I do run `python3 -m venv new-venv`.

It might be at position 0, 1, all the way up to 3 characters from the end of the string (since you need to have room for `\"bob\"` left). [SEP] Sasha: Then if it sees a `\"b\"` at one of those positions, it enters the inner `for` loop, where it checks each character in `\"bob\"` for a match. It exits the loop immediately if there's a mismatch, but if it completes the loop successfully, the `else` clause fires, and it increments a counter for how many `\"bob\"`s it has found. [SEP] Sasha: (I'm assuming you already know stuff like the `[]` notation for array indexing, etc. But feel free to ask about anything that's unclear. The `for-else` syntax is uncommon in other languages, for instance.)

For the low/high case, you could generate a random number between 1 and 1500, and take the range between 1001-1500 to be a duplicate of the 1-500 or 501-1000 range, giving you an extra chance of landing there.

[SEP] Leida: if you replace the list with a generator it works tho [SEP] Leida: ok i think i got it now [SEP] Leida: python has some cotchas but seems to have alot less of em than say javascript [SEP] Leida: the article im reading gives some workarounds but it it fails to use generators which makes it so that the range isnt iterated over before the for loop and everything is fine [SEP] Leida: ```using a default arg like so:\n\ndef create_multipliers():\n    return [lambda x, i=i : i * x for i in range(5)]\nAlternatively, you can use the functools.partial function:\n\nfrom functools import partial\nfrom operator import mul\n\ndef create_multipliers():\n    return [partial(mul, i) for i in range(5)]``` [SEP] Leida: the default arg route makes the whole thing even messier xD [SEP] Leida: give that line as an interview question :smiling_imp: [SEP] Chester: I think python gotchas can be counted on the fingers of one hand [SEP] Leida: often things arent even gotchas and are so by design [SEP] Leida: you can do clever stuff with advanced features [SEP] Leida: js seems to have gotchas as a result of naive design [SEP] Chester: I'd say the absence of design, yeah.

[SEP] Conchita: Thanks. How do I pass the `message` property as an argument into `myFunction`?\n\n```\n        .catch(err =&gt; {\n          logger.error({\n            loanId: id,\n            message: `Error encountered when syncing with status: ${err.status}`,\n            payload: err.statusMessage,\n            body: err.body\n          })\n          myFunction(message, callback, destination)``` [SEP] Conchita: FYI to test the code I'm working on, it needs to pass two people and often takes up to 3 days. I'm to fresh into JS to be able to write a similar function to test this [SEP] Conchita: So maybe I already got it or I'm missing something trivial. Great if you have some input [SEP] Deangelo: no worries, this is easy, one sec [SEP] Conchita: :pray: [SEP] Deangelo: ```\nsomePromise\n  .catch(err =&gt; {\n    const message = `Error encountered when syncing with status: ${err.status}`\n    logger.error({\n      loanId: id,\n      message,\n      payload: err.statusMessage,\n      body: err.body\n    })\n    myFunction(message, callback, destination)\n  })\n``` [SEP] Deangelo: so you extract the message into its own constant so you can use it in 2 different places. the logger and the custom function [SEP] Conchita: Awesome - can you please explain `message,`? What happens on that line? [SEP] Deangelo: sure, it's declaring a constant variable named `message`. its value is a string literal. string literals allow you to inject dynamic values in them. [SEP] Deangelo: as a result, the string literal ```\nError encountered when syncing with status: ${err.status}``` [SEP] Conchita: Ok great, was just about to ask if the constant could still access the variable \"err.status\", but you just answered it too [SEP] Conchita: Thank you so much! [SEP] Deangelo: becomes:\n```\nError encountered when syncing with status: 500\n```\nwhen err.status has the value 500 for example [SEP] Deangelo: yep [SEP] Conchita: One bonus question - for this function. My function takes in a callback as an argument. The issue is that, not all blocks of code where I need to call this function ahve a callback defined. [SEP] Conchita: Should I then modify my code to hav ethe callback as an optional argument or is there better solution for this? [SEP] Conchita: An example is the snippet you just helped me with [SEP] Conchita: It has no defined callback, but other code blocks do where it is required [SEP] Deangelo: ok, you can definitely make the callback optional [SEP] Deangelo: by checking if it's passed of not [SEP] Deangelo: ```\nfunction myFunction(message, cb) {\n  ... do stuff\n  if (cb) {\n    cb(someValue)\n  }\n}\n``` [SEP] Deangelo: it's also a common pattern to have a method that returns both a promise and supports callbacks so you can use it both ways.

Generally in coldfusion I run the test file like localhost:8500/test.cfm [SEP] Amparo: Okay I tried with open the particular file in IDLE. [SEP] Leida: ah so you wish to run it through testserver web api? [SEP] Amparo: And I can ran it by press f5 [SEP] Amparo: It;s will display the result [SEP] Leida: if you open command line in the folder that the file is in you can run the command i mentioned [SEP] Leida: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8551735/how-do-i-run-python-code-from-sublime-text-2> [SEP] Amparo: Again I changed something in my sublime , And Do I need to reopen that file in IDLE and run again ? is this only option ? [SEP] Leida: with this you can run it in the editor which does a similar thing in the background [SEP] Leida: you dont need to open it in IDLE [SEP] Leida: python isnt a compiled language so you dont need to run anything extra before running the script [SEP] Amparo: None [SEP] Leida: you dont seem to have python in your path. Have you installed python? [SEP] Amparo: My question is, If I open test.py file in both sublime &amp; IDLE. Then if once I change something in sublime that will not reflect in IDLE [SEP] Amparo: Yes. I can successfully run it via IDLE [SEP] Leida: um you would need to reload the file in IDLE for the updates to show. I dont know if IDLE has some setting to keep track of file changes or not. In general if you use sublime then you dont need to use IDLE [SEP] Leida: IDLE is a small editor that comes with the python installation [SEP] Amparo: Yes. So could you please help to run the py file via sublime [SEP] Leida: open up command prompt (windows key + r) and type in cmd [SEP] Leida: this will open up command prompt for you [SEP] Amparo: Each and every time I type the code in sublime and open the file in IDLE and press f5.. That was I'm doing each and every changes [SEP] Leida: then type in `python` and tell me what it says [SEP] Amparo: Internal &amp; external command issue [SEP] Amparo: python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file. [SEP] Leida: ok that means python is not in your path. That basically means that if you type python the executable is not found. This is what sublime does to find python. [SEP] Leida: you can follow this to add python to your path <https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/> [SEP] Leida: then do the sublime settings thing and then you can run python by pressing crtl+b [SEP] Leida: windows installation for python has a section where you can choose features, adding to path is one of them and by default it is off. Most any program that needs to use python will want python to be on path so you generally need to set it to install it.

[SEP] Leida: but you want to be able to access python from any folder [SEP] Leida: yes, you still dont have python in your path [SEP] Amparo: Okay. Then How I can install by default ? I mean inside program file instead of python34. [SEP] Amparo: Is this possible ? [SEP] Amparo: Got it Karl Uibo [SEP] Leida: the easiest solution would be to re-run the installer and add the option to add python to path - that should fix your woes. [SEP] Amparo: So you mean instead of install python in c:python34, We should install it in c:programfiles:python34 ? [SEP] Amparo: So that we no need to create environment variable / mapping etc.. [SEP] Amparo: Right ? [SEP] Hiroko: no [SEP] Amparo: So How I can debug my code here ? [SEP] Hiroko: we mean uninstall and reinstall with the pythin installer and check the option to add to path [SEP] Amparo: Yes. I choose by default path that is c:python43.

Is there any function for that. [SEP] Hiroko: there\u2019s a checkbox for that in the install to do that for you [SEP] Amparo: I mean developer debugging function anything ? [SEP] Hiroko: well, first, don\u2019t use IDLE [SEP] Amparo: Yes <@Hiroko> I did that already [SEP] Hiroko: I have no clue why its still included in the install [SEP] Amparo: Now I can ran the sample code via sublime [SEP] Hiroko: :thumbsup: [SEP] Amparo: by press ctrl + B [SEP] Leida: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29064081/run-python-debugger-pdb-in-sublime-text-3> [SEP] Amparo: I install two time.

[SEP] Hiroko: eg <https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Python%20Debugger>? [SEP] Hiroko: uhm\u2026 question [SEP] Hiroko: why are you installing python 3.4? [SEP] Hiroko: if you\u2019re starting out, why not use 3.7? [SEP] Amparo: No. I'm asking find bug and debug . For ex)  if I pass the argument to the function mean How I can check the argument received to that functions or what values come for that particular arguments etc... Like developer debugging tool. [SEP] Amparo: 3.7 ? [SEP] Amparo: Where I can download 3.7 ? For window 64 ? [SEP] Amparo: Could you send me the exact URL ?

[SEP] Hiroko: stable 3.7 [SEP] Leida: executable installer x86-64 for 64 bit python [SEP] Amparo: That will redirect to other link [SEP] Hiroko: that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m pointing to with the link above.  sublime is an editor, not an IDE [SEP] Amparo: Got it [SEP] Hiroko: so you need to add in the packages you want for the desired capability [SEP] Amparo: Fine. Now back to debugging concept ? [SEP] Amparo: I'm asking find bug and debug . For ex)  if I pass the argument to the function mean How I can check the argument received to that functions or what values come for that particular arguments etc... Like developer debugging tool. [SEP] Hiroko: I already answered that for you :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Hiroko: you\u2019re using sublime [SEP] Hiroko: that\u2019s an editor, not an IDE.  So if you want that, you need to install packages for that functionality [SEP] Hiroko: check out <https://realpython.com/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-full-stack-python-development/> for some good package and configuration suggestions for ST [SEP] Amparo: Fpr example in coldfusion if I dump( argument ) it will show all argument with its value in structure format. If I did abort(). then next line of any code will not excute [SEP] Amparo: Sure. I will take a look on your link <@Hiroko> Thank you [SEP] Hiroko: ok, gotcha.  I think you\u2019re going to find a very different experience with non coldfusion languages [SEP] Amparo: Yes :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Hiroko: FWIW, I have java, c, php, javascript and python experience [SEP] Hiroko: none of those languages really have similar things [SEP] Hiroko: well, php has `var_dump` [SEP] Amparo: Yes you got it my point clearly [SEP] Hiroko: you can do the same in python with `print(globals()`, and `print(locals())` [SEP] Leida: <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows> you can try the community edition to see if that works for you, but you would still have to learn to use it first [SEP] Amparo: So there is any way for it ? [SEP] Hiroko: how many IDEs are there for CF? [SEP] Amparo: Sublime, Vs code, coldfusion builder ( By default ) [SEP] My: So. Many. Notifications. :smile: [SEP] Leida: you can try with vs code too <https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/debugging%20python> [SEP] Amparo: Huh using VS code it's slow my system [SEP] Amparo: Even I'm having good configuration system [SEP] Amparo: So generally vs code take more time to load, Hang on.. etc.. [SEP] Amparo: So I always give priority to sublime text only :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Amparo: Any feedback about my point <@Leida> <@My> <@Hiroko> [SEP] Leida: if you dont use an ide which are more heavy weight then you are gonna have to put in more elbow grease to get things to work [SEP] Leida: can be a bit of fiddling and i personally havent worked with sublime to know what needs to be done [SEP] Amparo: SO you mean IDLE is best by default ? [SEP] My: personnally I never run code inside of sublime [SEP] Leida: aparently it does have a debugger inbulit - never used it. Certainly not the best, but is probably relatively light weight. <https://www.cs.uky.edu/~keen/help/debug-tutorial/debug.html> [SEP] My: I execute it in a terminal [SEP] Hiroko: IDLE is pretty crappy, FWIW [SEP] My: if I want to debug, I plug a debugger around the breaking point :shrug: [SEP] My: I use `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` because I keep forgetting `traceback()` exists [SEP] Alvina: if I type 'git status' on the terminal in Pycharm, i get different results inside of the same folder if I use 'git status' on WSL (bash for windows) [SEP] Hiroko: with python 3.7, `breakpoint` [SEP] Amparo: import pdb; pdb.set_trace,traceback(),breakpoint these are really looking good.

I am working with Panadas for the first time, and so far really liking it.  I am trying to do some analysis on phone records.  long term there are a few things I want to do, but focus right now is determining maximum number of concurrent calls to the PSTN at an individual location.  I have functioning code for this, but pretty sure there is a much better way of doing this (this works, but its slow).  the part below is the part I'm sure there is a better way.  prior to this snippet of code I am reading the CSV file(125 column, 15000 rows) into a dataframe, filtering it down to just the PSTN Calls, and just the columns I used for that purpose I end out with a dataframe that is is about 10250x6.  I'm then running it through loop below to poll the data and check minute by minute in my interested time period how many calls were active at the polling time.  This works ok, but it is slow, and I'm going to be missing data still (calls that start and end between polling periods), There are a few ways I can think of to catch those calls as well but it's going to make this even slower..is there a better way I should be doing this?  The idea is with the output then I can quickly find the max calls, I can graph the data show trending,  etc.\n```\n# create empty Dataframe to store results\ncall_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['dateTime', 'activeCalls'])\n\n# Loop through times in one minute incremenets between start and end time\nfor x in pd.date_range(start=start_time, end=end_time, freq=\"1Min\"):\n    # count number of calls that started before and ended after loop time\n    active_calls = len(pstn_calls[(pstn_calls['origTime'] &lt;= x) &amp; pstn_calls['disconnectTime'] &gt;= x)])\n    # append results to DataFrame\n    call_df = call_df.append({'dateTime': x, 'activeCalls': active_calls}, ignore_index=True)\n``` [SEP] Sasha: <@Vern> A couple of things come to mind.

[SEP] Christina: that depends on your OS. this is not really a python question, as it is simply depended on whether `python`is symlinked to `python3.*` or `python2.*` (on unix systems anyway..)\n\nWhat OS are you using? [SEP] Chester: Also, linking `python` to `python3` when your linux distro has it linked to `python2` will likely break everything [SEP] Christina: true! [SEP] Christina: so it also depends on which distro you use. but i hope the majority of your packages rely on py3, but that is probably naive [SEP] Tanja: I'm using Ubuntu [SEP] Chester: <@Tanja> I'd suggest to use <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv> [SEP] Chester: This cannot possibly break anything [SEP] Tanja: the Idea is that most packages I'm working with requires python3 [SEP] Tanja: I'm not working with virtual environment another way? [SEP] Christina: You should use virtual environments. However you can (also) add a alias mapping py to python3 in your .bashrc/zshrc (or what ever shell you use) [SEP] Chester: A virtual environment is bound to the interpreter used to create it. It cannot manage different python versions on the same machine [SEP] Chester: pyenv can [SEP] Tanja: if I used `locate python3` It gives looong &amp; many  paths, how should I knew which one I have to use [SEP] Christina: oic. well then pyenv should be your goto thing. but virtual environments are quite cool as well [SEP] Christina: use `which python3` not `locate python3` - locate finds all files that has `python3`it its name afaik [SEP] Tanja: ok. [SEP] Christina: `which python3` means \"upon writing `python3` which file is executed?` [SEP] Tanja: another question please, If I want to work with pyenv, what will happen to the already downloaded packages, like pymesh, plt,and I have to reinstall all in the pyenv? [SEP] Chester: Yes. As I said, virtual environments are bound to the interpreter used to create it. pyenv installs completely separate interpreters [SEP] Christina: <@Tanja> you hopefully use `requirements.txt` to save those :wink: [SEP] Tanja: Sorry guys I don't ave advanced knowledge in python so I feel not getting exactly the idea you are talking about :disappointed: [SEP] Christina: It's more of a linux thing than i python thing. So when using pyenv it creates an isolated 'environment' which has a singular interpreter (a `python3` executeable basically). Linked to that interpreter is an isolated set of modules etc. So when changing into a new environment, you can only access the packages that is installed on that specific interpreter.\nwhen activating a specific environment it creates an alias for that terminal that connects the command `python` to the specific interpreter. If you use Pycharm (the IDE / editor), you can also connect the editor to the specific environment. (probably the same for other editors)\n\n\nNormally, when using python (especially with virtual environments) you define a file called `requirements.txt` which stores the names of all packages a given project is depended on. (<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files>) [SEP] Tanja: but does this mean I can remove all the packages (installed without pyenv) normally and this won't affect my new work on the pyenv [SEP] Christina: i think it depends on the setup. i haven't used pyenv (i use virtualenv, which is  similar), but some solutions makes en environment inherit from the global modules. but *i would* install everything in the env and then remove the global packages (just make sure it is packages that you hav manually installed, and not something ubuntu depends on) [SEP] Chester: pyenv and virtualenv are two completely different tools [SEP] Chester: pyenv manages different python interpreters (e.g. py2.6, py2.7, py3.5, py3.6, etc), virtualenv manages project-specific python packages (i.e. things that are installed with `pip install`) [SEP] Christina: oic. but isn't the packages still interpreter specific? :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Chester: Sure [SEP] Chester: Both. [SEP] Chester: I have a very simple rule to decide whether a field should be a property or a method.\nIf computing this field requires I/O or any other sort of interactions with external systems (e.g. other classes that serve configuration), then it has to be a method.\nIf computing requires only the data available in `self`, then it should be a property.\nIf it requires no computing (i.e. the whole implementation is `return self._field`), then it should be just a regular field.

If you blindly bring OOP principles from c#/java to python you can end up with redundancy. [SEP] Chester: &gt; its so that you wont have to modify your interfaces when you need to add something to the access like logging or counting or what not\nIt's kinda stupid though. People make certain assumptions about how functions/methods operate.\nIf I see a `getName` method in java, I'd expect it to run blazingly fast - because it's essentially a field lookup.

[SEP] Ashley: Yeah, thanks [SEP] Roxie: Yup I can understand [SEP] Ashley: <@Lanelle> think about counting. We use base-10 for our number system, which means we have 10 characters to represent different numbers. We start with 0 and increment until we reach 9. What is the next thing we do, now that we've run out of characters? We \"carry the 1\" and start on the next number place with `10`. Notice how we have a 1 in the tens place and a 0 in the ones place. This is because we have 1 ten and 0 ones. We started over with the ones and looped back around to zero [SEP] Ashley: Binary works the same way. It's just a base-2 system, so there's only 2 number characters, and the number places are exponents of 2 instead of 10 (e.g. the ones place, the twos place, the fours place) [SEP] Ashley: If I wanted all the permutations of base-10 numbers that go up to 999, I would just start counting at 000 [SEP] Ashley: The trick is that the characters I use to represent the numbers doesn't actually matter, so long as they're consistent [SEP] Ashley: <@Roxie> so it looks like you're trying to scrape YouTube comments. Selenium is actually a very bad scraping tool. It's an abstraction around the WebDriver protocol, which is meant for automated testing that simulates user behavior.

[SEP] Chong: put the file where your code is (in the same directory) [SEP] Ashley: <@Starla> look at the reader object just above that one in the docs [SEP] Ashley: Keep in mind though [SEP] Starla: and what\u2019s this in that code?\n spamwriter.writerow([\u2018Spam\u2019] * 5 + [\u2018Baked Beans\u2019])\n   spamwriter.writerow([\u2018Spam\u2019, \u2018Lovely Spam\u2019, \u2018Wonderful Spam\u2019]) [SEP] Ashley: That this reads the file one line at a time, so it's best to read from one file, then write to a different, and then just rename the new file once it's finished [SEP] Ashley: That's how it writes one row [SEP] Starla: ok. i am still bit of lost, if can help with code? [SEP] Ashley: It took a list, and then treated each item in that list as one thing to put in that one row [SEP] Ashley: So when you look at the last row it would write in the CSV file, it would have this:\n\n```\nSpam,Lovely Spam,Wonderful Spam\n``` [SEP] Starla: ok. but then i want repeating my 300 rows , how can i use logic for that? [SEP] Starla: let\u2019s say filename = file_name [SEP] Ashley: A for loop would handle that fine [SEP] Starla: someone give me a full logic, please :face_with_rolling_eyes: [SEP] Ashley: We can't write it for you [SEP] Ashley: This is <#C07EFMZ1N|help>, not #domyworkforme [SEP] Ashley: We'll gladly help you along every step of the way though [SEP] Ashley: You have to open a file before you can read/write from/to it [SEP] Ashley: It'll probably be smoother if you have both files open at the same time [SEP] Ashley: So you can have a `with` inside another `with` [SEP] Starla: I am helping someone to do the work, that;s why, i am beginner at 0.1 level in python yet [SEP] Ashley: And that's great, but this is entry level stuff [SEP] Ashley: So don't worry about it being too difficult [SEP] Ashley: Take it one step at a time [SEP] Starla: csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' \u2018, quotechar=\u2018|')\nWhat does delimiter and quotechar do here? [SEP] Hiroko: tells you what characte is used for separating out the columns [SEP] Hiroko: and there\u2019s optional quote characters.  eg, single quote, double quote, etc [SEP] Starla: ok. [SEP] Starla: import csv\nwith open(\u2018File1.csv\u2019, \u2018w\u2019, newline=\u2018\u2019) as csvfile:\n=&gt; This helps me to open File1 &amp; then what is role of \u201ccsvfile\u201d ? [SEP] Hiroko: its a file object [SEP] Starla: means? [SEP] Hiroko: `open` asks the OS to provide a file descriptior to a file to allow read/write access to it [SEP] Hiroko: question, is this homework? [SEP] Starla: it\u2019s small project work for my sis, who asked me help that needs to submit by tomorrow morning. [SEP] Starla: Myself interested in python but i haven\u2019t started learning much yet [SEP] Hiroko: gotcha [SEP] Hiroko: when you say project for your sister, is this for work or school? [SEP] Starla: for university [SEP] Starla: she is in DS major, however she does not have much idea of python [SEP] Starla: i don\u2019t mean to give u guys her homework, just she is in the situation can\u2019t seek of much help so reached out to me. [SEP] Starla: she got her work done through shell script, however she is required to write the same code in python which is she unaware. her homework was to use data to Data Science, which she has done [SEP] Jimmy: DS ? ok datascience I guess [SEP] Ashley: To put it another way, `with open` is a context manager, which means that it has control over what happens when you first go into the `with` and also when you finally leave it. In this case, it opens the file, and closes it again when you leave. The `as csvfile` is providing you with a variable name that you can reference the file with. You can put anything you want there. Python doesn't understand that it's a CSV file yet though. It thinks it's just a normal file that happens to have a variable referencing it named \"csvfile\" [SEP] Ashley: <@Starla> that means this is her homework. In data science, python is the most popular language to use. She needs to learn how to do this herself. [SEP] Starla: I agree and i will ask her do. in case, part of help if i can offer for now to her, it would be useful [SEP] Ashley: It's great that you're trying to help her, but she really needs to learn this herself [SEP] Ashley: Have her join, and we'll walk her through just like we were with you [SEP] Starla: is there a way that i can use above code to import csv &amp; open file, then use below loop and multiply data? [SEP] Clemmie: <@Starla> that's cheating. If she would like to join the slack we would be happy to help her here, but most people will be uncomfortable teaching you so that you can do it for her [SEP] Starla: count = 0\nwhile (count &lt; 3):\n    count = count + 1 [SEP] Ashley: A for loop is better, because it can track the iterator for you [SEP] Ashley: But again, she needs to learn this herself [SEP] Starla: sure. i will ask her join. I joined here firstly for myself learning, still using slack bcz of company use at SAP. [SEP] Ashley: If you do it for her, you will only be hurting her in the long run [SEP] Clemmie: that's great! we'll happily help you on your work, and her on hers! [SEP] Ashley: The next assignment will build on this one, and if she doesn't understand how to do this one on her own, she won't be able to complete the next one [SEP] Starla: i am interested in learning python actually for my work, just i haven\u2019t started yet. need to push myself through such situation [SEP] Ashley: That's great! [SEP] Ashley: We'd love to help [SEP] Ashley: Both you _and_ your sister [SEP] Starla: working on cloud field, it\u2019s good and highly required skill [SEP] Ashley: Definitely [SEP] Starla: Yup. and yet, i will ask her, we are not in same place. I am in china and she\u2019s in AU. so can ask her to join later, may be tomorrow [SEP] Ashley: Sounds good [SEP] Starla: Thanks for u guys help and advice [SEP] Ashley: :+1: [SEP] Marth: Sadly, I'm not familiar with pyspark", "2431": "Clemmie: So she gave you her homework?

You can apply logic to it and anything inside it just like any other form of data [SEP] Ashley: If there's something in that dict that tells you comments are disabled, you can look at that [SEP] Ashley: Even if it doesn't explicitly say something like \"comments disabled\" [SEP] Roxie: <@Christina> Yup that is not a feature from API [SEP] Roxie: <@Ashley> I applied a condition like if the comment count is 0 assume that comments are disabled [SEP] Roxie: Is that right way to follow [SEP] Christina: My point was essentially what Salmon explained way better. the 'right way' is just the best way to solve your problem. Whether your solution is sufficient, depends on the problem you are trying to solve.

Python is all about `ask for forgiveness rather than permission` - afaik python is optimized regarding exceptions that you can essentially use them as flags to parse around. but your solution is fine but i would probably add the exception that can be cast by `influx`. This except would also get caught if for instance the system tries to shut down the program gracefully, meaning the program wont shut down but rather tell your system that the db write failed.

[SEP] Clemmie: even though it is internal, these are for internal \u201cusers\u201d [SEP] Jesusa: devs / network engineers, doesn\u2019t matter [SEP] Clemmie: who want to be insulated from the need to do anything besides `$ run_script` [SEP] Jesusa: None [SEP] Jesusa: I guarantee you there is no easier way of doing this [SEP] Clemmie: that is a fine answer and I agree with that [SEP] Romaine: we have tooling where I work written completely in Python that installs via brew or apt that creates a virtual env, but doesn't require the user to have any idea that it uses virtual env or even Python [SEP] Carlo: just creating aliases or wrapper scripts to run the script with python within the virtual environment, put in $PATH would work too [SEP] Clemmie: ultimately <@Catherina> you have your answer here, in many forms. None of it might be what you want to hear, but all correct and complete [SEP] Romaine: mind you, the tooling is also for network security at the hosting provider I work at, and the majority of the scripts its made of was written almost entirely by Network Security Engineers writing Python [SEP] Clemmie: Agreed. my biggest sticking point on this whole thing is the requirement that Network Engineers not need to understand how to spin up and run a venv [SEP] Clemmie: I would be hiring a new network team if that excuse was given [SEP] Catherina: &gt; who want to be insulated from the need to do anything besides `$ run_script` [SEP] Ashley: network engineers should be able to handle that pretty easily [SEP] Catherina: essentially this ^ [SEP] Romaine: yup! not every Network Engineer wants to learn code, but I am an incredible advocate for the ability to code to be a major part of a Network Engineers profile [SEP] Ashley: <@Catherina> then you should make a service that they send requests to [SEP] Clemmie: ^ if they can\u2019t be trusted to run python correctly [SEP] Ashley: actually, network engineers still need to learn scripting and understand shell environments very well in order to do their job [SEP] Romaine: not always <@Ashley> [SEP] Catherina: Anyway I see what you guys mean. Now it\u2019s just a matter of figuring out how to apply this. I\u2019ve worked in Amazon where we had these boxes were all our tools would get deployed to, everything would be in your path once you ssh into the box. [SEP] Romaine: but the most successful Network Engineers should know code [SEP] Catherina: With no knowledge of virtual envs etc [SEP] Catherina: just want to replicate that, but unsure how they set it up [SEP] Ashley: if they're newbies, I would not expect them to have that level of knowledge, but virtual environments literally just manipulate the $PATH variable, and if they didn't understand how that worked, that would raise several red flags [SEP] Jesusa: they probably did exactly what I told you to do [SEP] Jesusa: virtualenvs do not just manipulate $PATH [SEP] Jesusa: there\u2019s a ton of stuff going on [SEP] Ashley: kind of. they make a duplicate install of python, and then manipulate the $PATH to point to that install [SEP] Clemmie: as a shorthand, yes that is what they do [SEP] Ashley: technically, it doesn't even have to be an install of python [SEP] Catherina: thanks <@Jesusa> [SEP] Catherina: and others [SEP] Catherina: I\u2019ll try to figure out how to make this work in practice [SEP] Ashley: it's just an alternate bin, include, and lib folder [SEP] Jesusa: symlinks, not copies [SEP] Ashley: nah, it's a copy [SEP] Clemmie: I\u2019ve never heard of it being a symlink [SEP] Clemmie: it is a copy [SEP] Ashley: there's symlinks in there, but they just point back to the copy of python [SEP] Ashley: i.e. [SEP] Ashley: ```\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 nejame nejame       9 Mar 14 12:07 python -&gt; python3.7\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 nejame nejame       9 Mar 14 12:07 python3 -&gt; python3.7\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 nejame nejame 4857312 Mar 14 12:07 python3.7\n``` [SEP] Romaine: we have CCIEs where I work that do not know code, and it makes me lose respect for them, even with the power that cert holds [SEP] Catherina: CCIE != coding [SEP] Romaine: at that point in a Network Engineers career, they should be talking about forward progress, and networks configured mostly by hand in any scope is a liability [SEP] Catherina: I am a CCIE but coding is different. [SEP] Ashley: that blows my mind [SEP] Ashley: <@Catherina> do you know how the `$PATH` variable works? [SEP] Catherina: I do. [SEP] Ashley: ok [SEP] Ashley: then you're fine [SEP] Romaine: congrats on that, and I respect you immensely for that cert, but if you are not doing anything to further the future of Network Engineering, then all I can say is that you would be worth even more with more knowledge in Code/Automation [SEP] Ashley: I would be amazed if you didn't [SEP] Romaine: me too [SEP] Jesusa: None [SEP] Romaine: but like I said, I know a few CCIE who don't and don't think its important at all [SEP] Jesusa: default symlinks unless `nt` [SEP] Jesusa: looks like the primary interpreter is a copy though, depends on the version however [SEP] Ashley: I'm not saying you need to know python to be CCIE, but you should know how to write a script, and understand the shell well enough to know how $PATH works [SEP] Ashley: you'd have to go to some extreme lengths to avoid that information when getting the CCIE cert [SEP] Romaine: agreed [SEP] Catherina: Oh, of course :thumbsup: [SEP] Clemmie: <@Jesusa> where did you find that code? [SEP] Clemmie: Not arguing, just interested [SEP] Jesusa: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html> [SEP] Catherina: What I\u2019m talking about here is how to setup a dev/qa/prod environment [SEP] Jesusa: the official package [SEP] Catherina: something I never had to do in Amazon because it was all already there [SEP] Catherina: :cold_sweat: [SEP] Jesusa: they\u2019re hinting symlinks should be the default [SEP] Ashley: <@Jesusa> that just suggests that `nt` is the primary exception [SEP] Ashley: not the default [SEP] Ashley: ah sorry I misread [SEP] Jesusa: symlinks on mine [SEP] Jesusa: None [SEP] Clemmie: Interesting. Historically (pre-venv) it was not. I don\u2019t feel strongly one way or another. Also that flag help is atrocious \u201cuse symlinks if this wouldn\u2019t by default. Where would it by default? who knows!\u201d [SEP] Clemmie: I\u2019m torn on the idea [SEP] Jesusa: I don\u2019t care either way [SEP] Jesusa: :slightly_smiling_face: [SEP] Jesusa: happy to hlep [SEP] Clemmie: faster setup, sure [SEP] Clemmie: dirties up /usr/local though [SEP] Clemmie: eh, I use containers, so it doesn\u2019t matter [SEP] Ashley: oh wait [SEP] Ashley: we're reading it backwards [SEP] Ashley: ah nevermind [SEP] Ashley: I think I've read it assbackwards [SEP] Clemmie: venv will default to symlinks for the main python interpreter, unless it is on `nt`, unless you use the `--use-symlinks` flag [SEP] Ashley: yeah [SEP] Ashley: one sec [SEP] Clemmie: so that flag is (current;y) only meaningful on nt [SEP] Ashley: trying with pure venv [SEP] Clemmie: that is pure venv [SEP] Clemmie: virtualenv is different [SEP] Ashley: yeah [SEP] Ashley: the one I pulled from earlier was made with something else [SEP] Ashley: so I wanted to try again with the pure venv [SEP] Ashley: and I stand corrected [SEP] Ashley: but yeah, that irks me [SEP] Ashley: the point of the venv is to avoid conflicts with the system level install as well as other installs [SEP] Ashley: upgrading the system level install could break the venv [SEP] Ashley: <@Jesusa> :taco: [SEP] Ashley: what's up with `nt` though? [SEP] Hiroko: windows, I think [SEP] Hiroko: specifically windows NT versions [SEP] Hiroko: comes from this:  <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/sysmodule.c#L1957-L1982> [SEP] Hiroko: either `posix` or `nt` [SEP] Hiroko: <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/os.py#L6> [SEP] Jesusa: <@Ashley> How is a copy of an interpreter different from a symlink? [SEP] Holly: symlink goes to the location you have it pointed to [SEP] Clemmie: for tooling that have to have know, pinned versions, that is not great [SEP] Jesusa: that\u2019s the equivalent of saying \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t symlink openssh\u201d because anyone should be able to swap the binary in /usr/bin [SEP] Jesusa: but they\u2019re keeping ruby? <@Hiroko> [SEP] Hiroko: <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_10_15_beta_release_notes> [SEP] Hiroko: &gt;&gt;&gt;\u2022 Scripting language runtimes such as Python, Ruby, and Perl are included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software.

(51097165) [SEP] Clemmie: if I had a contract/regulation, say in healthcare, where all versions needed to be pinned and had catastrophic regulatory penalties if it changed without approval, you would be sure I am copying and not symlinking openssh too [SEP] Jesusa: If I had a contract/regulation I would ensure the binaries have only executable permissions, and that\u2019s it [SEP] Clemmie: <@Mariah> I would look to see if the external app had an api to use [SEP] Ashley: or, just make it a service for the to query directly [SEP] Catherina: what I wanted was for something centralized [SEP] Carmen: <@Catherina> If you're dead set on this particular implementation path, I would recommend that you have your Jenkins server package up the virtualenv along with the script so that it's all one artifact. Then you deploy that artifact to your servers, along with a wrapper script that activates the virtualenv and runs the actual script. Drop a symlink to that wrapper script in `/usr/bin` and make it executable by the users who should be allowed to run it.

If there was an api where you could pull the last_changed of a widget, you could poll that [SEP] Clemmie: If you get into running a lot of these, every second, you will end up with a backed up queue [SEP] Jesusa: why do you need to parse the html? just check the site\u2019s checksum before parsing [SEP] Jesusa: I ran the scraper fleet for <http://quandl.com|quandl.com> this works nicely [SEP] Jesusa: in fact, there\u2019s a specific http request to get the checksum [SEP] Mariah: how do i get the checksum? [SEP] Jesusa: I did this a long time ago [SEP] Mariah: I agree. A webhook would be ideal but not all platforms have this [SEP] Jesusa: `HEAD` will work [SEP] Jesusa: if they\u2019re fully REST compliant [SEP] Jesusa: you might be able to just get the Last-Modified field [SEP] Clemmie: absolutely. your polling idea has a good core, I would just be aware of the cases where it might break sown [SEP] Jesusa: else just `hash()` the request content [SEP] Catherina: but in a more robust way?

[SEP] Ashley: sorry, I meant why did it get special treatment [SEP] Clemmie: <@Catherina> you would be better off writing a quick howto document for your scripts - spin up the env, run. If they depend on a python package that is not in the standard python install you can even catch the `ImportError` and print the venv startup help text [SEP] Catherina: Yeah but I want people to just be able to ssh into box -&gt; have all scripts in user\u2019s $PATh [SEP] Catherina: clearly explicitly setting the venv python\u2019s path in the python script is\u2026 well, not optimal [SEP] Catherina: but not sure what are better alternatives [SEP] Ashley: <@Catherina> I agree with <@Clemmie>. if they are SSH'ing into the box and calling the script, then they can read the `README`.
